Your symphony lifts listeners from their worldly concerns. Attempt a Performance check to [counteract](Counteracting.md) one of the following conditions affecting the target: [Grabbed](Grabbed.md), [Immobilized](Immobilized.md), [Paralyzed](Paralyzed.md), [Restrained](Restrained.md), [Slowed](Slowed.md), or [Stunned](Stunned.md). If you fail, you can't target that effect on the target for 1 day. Use the condition's source to determine the counteract DC (for example, the [Escape](Escape.md) DC for grabbed).

<hr>

**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to four creatures.
