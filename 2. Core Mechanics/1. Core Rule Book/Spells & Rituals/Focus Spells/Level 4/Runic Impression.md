**Cast** â–º somatic
**Range** touch; **Targets** you or one weapon you're wielding
**Duration** 1 minute

Your unarmed attacks or weapon gain the benefits of a weapon rune you choose when you cast this spell: [Corrosive](Corrosive.md), [Flaming](Flaming.md), [Frost](Frost.md), [Ghost Touch](Ghost%20Touch.md), [Returning](Returning.md), [Shock](Shock.md), or [Thundering](Thundering.md). If you cast runic impression on a weapon, this spell ends if you cease holding the weapon.

If this spell would give a weapon more property runes than its normal maximum, one of the existing property runes (you choose) is suppressed until the spell ends.

For [Unarmed](Unarmed.md) attacks, if this spell would give you more property runes than you could have from [Handwraps of Mighty Blows](Handwraps%20of%20Mighty%20Blows.md), one of the existing property runes is similarly suppressed.

**Heightened (8th)** Add [Keen](Keen.md) to the list of runes you can choose as well as the greater types of corrosive, flaming, frost, shock, and thundering.
