The target weapon becomes translucent and ghostly, and it can affect material and [Incorporeal](Incorporeal.md) creatures and objects. It can be wielded by a corporeal or incorporeal creature and gains the effects of the [Ghost Touch](Ghost%20Touch.md) property rune. If the weapon is [Magical](Magical.md) and already has the maximum number of property runes, the wielder can choose one to suppress to gain ghost touch.
