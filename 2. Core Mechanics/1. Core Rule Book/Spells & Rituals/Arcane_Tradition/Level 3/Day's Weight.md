You fast-forward time for a single creature, burdening it with the aches and pain of an entire day and making it temporarily tired and weak. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is [Fatigued](Fatigued.md) and [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 1 for 1 round.  
**Failure** The target is [Fatigued](Fatigued.md) and [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 1 for the duration.  
**Critical Failure** The target is [Fatigued](Fatigued.md) and [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 2 for the duration. The [Fatigued](Fatigued.md) condition doesn't end when the spell's duration

does (but can still be removed with a night's rest or by similar means).

<hr>

**Heightened (6th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
