You shoot an utterly cold ray of [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) tinged with unholy energy. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. You deal `dice: 5d6|avg` cold damage, plus `dice: 5d6|avg` evil damage if the target is a celestial.

If the ray passes through an area of magical light or targets a creature affected by magical light, chilling [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) attempts to [counteract](Counteracting.md) the light. If you need to determine whether the ray passes through an area of light, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.

**Critical Success** The target takes double damage.  
**Success** The target takes full damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`, and the evil damage against celestials increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`.
