You create a cloud of putrid mist in the area. The cloud functions as obscuring mist except it sickens creatures that end their turns within the cloud. (The [Concealed](Concealed.md) condition is not a poison effect.)

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature is [Sickened](Sickened.md) 1.  
**Failure** The creature is [Sickened](Sickened.md) 1 and [Slowed](Slowed.md) 1 while in the cloud.  
**Critical Failure** The creature is [Sickened](Sickened.md) 2 and [Slowed](Slowed.md) 1 until it leaves the cloud.
