Using the weight of earth, you hamper a target's flight, with effects based on its Fortitude save. If the creature reaches the ground safely, it doesn't take falling damage.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target falls safely up to 120 feet.  
**Failure** The target falls safely up to 120 feet. If it hits the ground, it can't Fly, levitate, or otherwise leave the ground for 1 round.  
**Critical Failure** The target falls safely up to 120 feet. If it hits the ground, it can't Fly, levitate, or otherwise leave the ground for 1 minute.
