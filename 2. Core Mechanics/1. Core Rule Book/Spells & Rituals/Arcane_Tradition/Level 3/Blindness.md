You blind the target. The effect is determined by the target's Fortitude save. The target then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is [Blinded](Blinded.md) until its next turn begins.  
**Failure** The target is [Blinded](Blinded.md) for 1 minute.  
**Critical Failure** The target is [Blinded](Blinded.md) permanently.
