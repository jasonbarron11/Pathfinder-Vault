You invoke all things that seep and ooze, your body dissolving into a thick slurry and then reconstituting itself into a Medium ooze battle form. When you first cast this spell, choose black pudding, gelatinous cube, gray ooze, or ochre jelly. While in this form, you gain the [Ooze](Ooze.md) trait. You can Dismiss the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 7 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 20 temporary Hit Points.
- You are immune to critical hits, precision damage, and visual effects.
- Resistance 5 to [Acid](Acid.md), piercing, and slashing damage.
- No vision and motion sense 30 feet. You can sense nearby motion through vibration and air movement as a precise sense.
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +14, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- Athletics modifier of +14, unless your own is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the ooze:

- **Black Pudding** _Speed_ 15 feet, climb 15 feet; **Melee ► pseudopod**, Damage `dice: 2d6+5|avg` bludgeoning and `dice: 1d8|avg` acid.
- **Gelatinous Cube** _Speed_ 15 feet; **Melee ► cube face**, Damage `dice: 1d6+5|avg` acid; a creature hit by your cube face Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or be [Stunned](Stunned.md) 1 (or [Paralyzed](Paralyzed.md) for 1 round on a critical failure); this save has the incapacitation trait.
- **Gray Ooze** _Speed_ 15 feet, climb 15 feet, swim 15 feet; **Melee ► pseudopod**, Damage `dice: 1d6+5|avg` bludgeoning and `dice: 1d6|avg` acid, and you can spend an action after a hit to [Grab](Grab.md) the target.
- **Ochre Jelly** _Speed_ 15 feet, climb 10 feet; resistance 5 to electricity; **Melee ► pseudopod**, Damage `dice: 1d8+5|avg` bludgeoning and `dice: 1d8|avg` acid, and you can spend an action after a hit to [Grab](Grab.md) the target.
