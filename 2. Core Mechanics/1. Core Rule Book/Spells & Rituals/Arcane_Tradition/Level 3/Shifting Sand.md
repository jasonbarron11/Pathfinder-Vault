You cause the surface to heave. The area becomes difficult terrain and any tracks in the area are destroyed by the churning ground. Creatures standing in the area take a –1 status penalty to Acrobatics checks to [Balance](Balance.md) and [Tumble Through](Tumble%20Through.md) and Athletics checks to [High Jump](High%20Jump.md) and [Long Jump](Long%20Jump.md). The first time each round you Sustain the Spell, you can move the churning area up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures [Immobilized](Immobilized.md) by the spell are carried along with the shifting sand in the same direction, if possible; this movement is [Forced Movement](Forced%20Movement.md). Creatures that enter or begin their turn standing in the shifting sand must attempt a Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and ignores the area’s difficult terrain and penalty to skill checks until the end of its turn.
