Blossoms grow from the ground in a small area, soothing away afflictions and persistent pains and harm. When any creature in that area rolls a successful save against a [Poison](Poison.md) or [Disease](Disease.md) effect, it gets a critical success instead. The blossoms grant assisted recovery to everyone in the area to end their [Persistent Damage](Persistent%20Damage.md), both when the spell is cast and at the start of each of your turns.

Once the duration ends, the flowers lose their magical effect, but a few of them might survive in the area as long as they can naturally. This spell doesn't give a benefit on a save against an affliction unless the stage lasts 10 minutes or less.
