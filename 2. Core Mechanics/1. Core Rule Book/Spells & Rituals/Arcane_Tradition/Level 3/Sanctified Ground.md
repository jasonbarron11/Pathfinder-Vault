You sanctify the area, sprinkling it with [Holy Water](Holy%20Water.md) and warding it against your foes. Choose aberrations, celestials, dragons, fiends, monitors, or undead. All creatures in the area gain a +1 status bonus to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against the chosen creatures.
