You envision a simple bug and transform into a Medium animal battle form. When you cast this spell, choose ant, beetle, centipede, mantis, scorpion, or spider. You can decide the specific type of animal (such as such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the [Animal](Animal.md) trait. You can Dismiss this spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 10 temporary Hit Points.
- [Low-light vision](Senses#Low-Light%20Vision).
- One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +13, and your damage bonus is +2. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) condition). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- Athletics modifier of +13, unless your own is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:

- **Ant** _Speed_ 30 feet, climb Speed 30 feet; **Melee ► mandibles**, _Damage_ `dice: 2d6|avg` bludgeoning.
- **Beetle** _Speed_ 25 feet; **Melee ► mandibles** , _Damage_ `dice: 2d10|avg` bludgeoning.
- **Centipede** _Speed_ 25 feet, climb _Speed_ 25 feet; darkvision; **Melee ► mandibles**, _Damage_ `dice: 1d8|avg` piercing plus `dice: 1d4|avg` persistent poison.
- **Mantis** _Speed_ 40 feet; imprecise scent 30 feet; **Melee ► foreleg** , _Damage_ `dice: 2d8|avg` bludgeoning.
- **Scorpion** _Speed_ 40 feet; darkvision, imprecise tremorsense 60 feet; **Melee ► stinger**, _Damage_ `dice: 1d8|avg` piercing plus `dice: 1d4|avg` persistent poison; **Melee ► pincer** (agile), Damage `dice: 1d6|avg` bludgeoning.
- **Spider** Speed 25 feet, climb Speed 25 feet; darkvision; **Melee ► fangs**, Damage 1d6 piercing plus 1d4 persistent poison; **Ranged ► web** (range increment 20 feet), _Damage_ [entangles](Entangle.md) the target for 1 round.
