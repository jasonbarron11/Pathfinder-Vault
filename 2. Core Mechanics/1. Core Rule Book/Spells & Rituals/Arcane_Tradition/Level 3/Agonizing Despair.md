Your target's mind tumbles down a deep well of dread, dwelling so intently on deep-seated fears that it's painful. The target takes `dice: 4d6|avg` mental damage with a Will saving throw.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half damage and becomes [Frightened](Frightened.md) 1.  
**Failure** The target takes full damage and becomes [Frightened](Frightened.md) 2.  
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and becomes [Frightened](Frightened.md) 3.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by `dice: 2d6|avg`.
