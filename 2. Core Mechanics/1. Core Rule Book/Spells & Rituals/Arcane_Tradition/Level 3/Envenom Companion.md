You envenom your companion or eidolon's attacks, which drip with highly toxic venom for the spell's duration. The first time each round the target hits a creature with an unarmed Strike that deals piercing or slashing damage, that Strike deals an additional `dice: 1d8|avg` poison damage. A creature that is damaged by this poison must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, it's also [Clumsy](Clumsy.md) 1 for 1 round.

This spell can't target familiars.

<hr>

**Heightened (+3)** The poison damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg` and the [Clumsy](Clumsy.md) value imposed on a failed save increases by 1.
