You alter a creature's shadow, transforming it into a terrifying monster out to devour the creature. The creature must attempt a Will save. A creature that has the [Frightened](Frightened.md) condition from unspeakable shadow must spend at least one of its actions each turn to either attack its shadow (making a Strike ineffectually) or flee from its shadow (using one action to move away as though it had the [Fleeing](Fleeing.md) condition).

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is [Frightened](Frightened.md) 2.  
**Failure** The target is [Frightened](Frightened.md) 3. It can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.  
**Critical Failure** The target is so afraid, it might instantly die. It must succeed at a Fortitude save or die; this saving throw has the [Incapacitation](Incapacitation.md) trait. If it succeeds at its save, the target is frightened 4 and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.
