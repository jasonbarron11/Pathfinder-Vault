Animals and plants in the area turn against the targets. Each target suffers from the following effects as long as it remains in the area.

- Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each target a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any time it's adjacent to the plants.
- Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal `dice: 2d10|avg` slashing damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save, and it is [Flat-footed](Flat-footed.md) for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success.
- The target loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. The target has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore, animal or plant creatures become [Hostile](Hostile.md) to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal companion.  
The GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.
