You send the target back to its home plane. The target must attempt a Will save. You can spend an extra action while Casting this Spell and add a material component to give the creature a –2 circumstance penalty to its save. The component must be a specially gathered object that is anathema to the creature, and not from a [Material Component Pouch](Material%20Component%20Pouch.md). This spell fails if you aren't on your home plane when you cast it.

**Critical Success** The target resists being banished and you are [Stunned](Stunned.md) 1.  
**Success** The target resists being banished.  
**Failure** The target is banished.  
**Critical Failure** The target is banished and can't return by any means to the plane it's banished from for 1 week.

<hr>
**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to 10 creatures. The extra material component affects targets to which it is anathema.
