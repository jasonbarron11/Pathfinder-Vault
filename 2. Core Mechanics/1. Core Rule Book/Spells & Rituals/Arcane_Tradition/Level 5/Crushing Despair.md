You inflict despair on creatures in the area. The effects for each creature are determined by its Will save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** For 1 round, the creature can't use reactions and must attempt another save at the start of its turn; on a failure, it is [Slowed](Slowed.md) 1 for that turn as it sobs uncontrollably.  
**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature is automatically [Slowed](Slowed.md) 1 for 1 minute.

<hr>

**Heightened (7th)** The area increases to a 60-foot cone.
