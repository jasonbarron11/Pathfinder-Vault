You shape the quasi-real substance of the Shadow Plane into a blast. Choose acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, force, piercing, slashing, or sonic damage, and choose a 30-foot cone, a 15-foot burst within 120 feet, or a 50-foot line. The blast deals `dice: 5d8|avg` damage of the type you chose to each creature in the area.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`.
