Your touch afflicts the target with Abyssal plague, which siphons fragments of their soul away to empower the Abyss. The effect is based on the target's Fortitude save.

**Abyssal Plague** ([Disease](Disease.md)); Level 9. The target can't recover from the [Drained](Drained.md) condition from Abyssal plague until the disease is cured. **Stage 1** [Drained](Drained.md) 1 (1 day); **Stage 2** [Drained](Drained.md) increases by 2 (1 day).

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes 2 evil damage per spell level, and takes a –2 status penalty to saves against Abyssal plague for 1 day or until the target contracts it, whichever comes first.  
**Failure** The target is afflicted with Abyssal plague at stage 1.  
**Critical Failure** The target is afflicted with Abyssal plague at stage 2.
