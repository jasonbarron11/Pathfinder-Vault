A thin crack rips through the earth, erupting with magma, then swiftly seals up. Each creature along the line and on solid ground takes `dice: 4d6|avg` bludgeoning damage and `dice: 6d6|avg` fire damage with a Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes half damage.  
**Failure** The creature takes full damage, and it falls [Prone](Prone.md).  
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, and it falls [Prone](Prone.md).

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg` bludgeoning and `dice: 1d6|avg` fire.
