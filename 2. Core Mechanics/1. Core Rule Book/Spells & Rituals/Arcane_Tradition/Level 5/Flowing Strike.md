A wave of flowing water rushes behind you like an elegant river, pushing you across the battlefield with fluid grace. You Stride up to 50 feet. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can make a Strike at any point during your Stride. If your Strike hits, the wave flows after you to batter the target of your Strike as well, dealing `dice: 2d10|avg` bludgeoning damage and [pushing](Forced%20Movement.md) it 10 feet in a direction of your choice.
