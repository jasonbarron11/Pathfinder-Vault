You conjure a poisonous fog. This functions as [Obscuring Mist](Obscuring%20Mist.md), except the area moves 10 feet away from you each round. You deal `dice: 6d8|avg` poison damage to each breathing creature that starts its turn in the spell's area. You can Dismiss the spell.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`.
