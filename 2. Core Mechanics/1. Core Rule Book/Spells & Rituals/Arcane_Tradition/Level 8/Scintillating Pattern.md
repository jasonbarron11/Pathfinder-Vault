A field of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air. Creatures are [Dazzled](Dazzled.md) while inside the pattern, as are those within 20 feet of the pattern's area. A creature must attempt a Will save if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a [Seek](Seek.md) or [Interact](Interact.md) action on the pattern. A creature currently affected by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Failure** The creature is [Confused](Confused.md) for `dice: 1d4|avg` rounds.  
**Critical Failure** The creature is [Stunned](Stunned.md) for `dice: 1d4|avg` rounds. After the [Stunned](Stunned.md) condition ends, the creature is [Confused](Confused.md) for the remaining duration of the spell.
