You call forth a divine cataclysm from your deity, destroying living and undead creatures in the area alike. Creatures in the area take `dice: 10d6|avg` negative damage and `dice: 10d6|avg` alignment damage (good, evil, lawful, or chaotic), chosen from among the alignments your deity has. If your deity is true neutral, increase the negative damage by `dice: 4d6|avg` instead of dealing alignment damage.

A creature harmed by positive damage, such as one with negative healing, takes positive damage instead of negative damage from this spell.

You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity. This spell gains the trait corresponding to the alignment damage dealt.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg` negative damage, `dice: 1d6|avg` alignment damage, and `dice: 1d6|avg` additional negative and positive damage for a true neutral deity.
