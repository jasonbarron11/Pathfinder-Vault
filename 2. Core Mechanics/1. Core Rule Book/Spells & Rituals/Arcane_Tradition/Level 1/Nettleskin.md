Thorns sprout from your body; they pass through and don't damage any clothing or armor you wear. Adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee or unarmed attack take `dice: 1d4|avg` piercing damage as the nettles jab them and break off. Each time a creature takes damage in this way, nettleskin's duration decreases by 1 round.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.
