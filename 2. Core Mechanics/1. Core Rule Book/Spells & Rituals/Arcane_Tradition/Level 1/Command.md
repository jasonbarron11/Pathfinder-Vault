You shout a command that's hard to ignore. You can command the target to approach you, run away (as if it had the fleeing condition), release what it's holding, drop prone, or stand in place. It can't Delay or take any reactions until it has obeyed your command. The effects depend on the target's Will save.

- **Success** The creature is unaffected
- **Failure** For the first action on its next turn, the creature must use a single action to do as you command
- **Critical Failure** The target must use all its actions on its next turn to obey your command

**Heightened (5th)** You can target up to 10 creatures
