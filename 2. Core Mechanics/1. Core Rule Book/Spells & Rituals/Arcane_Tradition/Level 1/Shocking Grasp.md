__Source__ Core Rulebook pg. 369 3.0  
**Traditions** arcane, primal  
**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal  
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 creature  
You shroud your hands in a crackling field of lightning. Make a melee spell attack roll. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 2d12|avg` electricity damage. If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you gain a `dice: 1d20+1|avg|nodice` circumstance bonus to your attack roll with shocking grasp, and the target also takes `dice: 1d4|avg` persistent electricity damage on a hit. On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the [Persistent Damage](Persistent%20Damage.md).

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d12, and the persistent electricity damage increases by 1.
