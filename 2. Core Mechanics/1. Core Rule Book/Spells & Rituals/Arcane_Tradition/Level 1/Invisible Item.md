You make the object [Invisible](Invisible.md). This makes it [Undetected](Undetected.md) to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it [Hidden](Hidden.md) to them instead if they succeed. If the item is used as part of a [Hostile](Hostile.md) action, the spell ends after that [Hostile](Hostile.md) action is completed.

Making a weapon [Invisible](Invisible.md) typically doesn't give any advantage to the attack, except that an [Invisible](Invisible.md) [Thrown](Thrown.md) weapon or piece of ammunition can be used for an attack without necessarily giving information about the attacker's hiding place unless the weapon returns to the attacker.
