As part of Casting this Spell, you [Recall Knowledge](Recall%20Knowledge.md) using Society to gain information about the immediate social situation. You also gain a +1 status bonus on your next Diplomacy check to [Make an Impression](Make%20an%20Impression.md) on those creatures present when you cast this spell, as long as the check occurs during the duration of the spell.
