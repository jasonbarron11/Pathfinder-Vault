Gnawing worms materialize within the flesh of the target creature, dealing `dice: 4d6|avg` piercing damage and `dice: 1d6|avg` persistent piercing damage. If the target is a non-skeletal corporeal undead creature, you deal an extra `dice: 2d6|avg` persistent piercing damage. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The worms writhe away harmlessly and the target takes no damage.  
**Success** The target takes full initial damage but no [Persistent Damage](Persistent%20Damage.md), and the spell ends immediately.  
**Failure** The target takes full initial and [Persistent Damage](Persistent%20Damage.md) and is [Flat-footed](Flat-footed.md) due to the pain for as long as it takes [Persistent Damage](Persistent%20Damage.md).  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double the initial damage and is also [Slowed](Slowed.md) 1 by the pain for as long as it takes [Persistent Damage](Persistent%20Damage.md).

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The initial and [Persistent Damage](Persistent%20Damage.md) increase by `dice: 2d6|avg` and `dice: 1d6|avg`, respectively.
