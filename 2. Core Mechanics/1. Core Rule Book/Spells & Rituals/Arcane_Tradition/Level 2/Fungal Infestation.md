# Fungal Infestation

**Traditions** primal

**Range** touch; **Area** 15-foot cone  
**Saving Throw** Fortitude

Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them to erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths deal `dice: 2d6|avg` persistent poison damage, and each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half the persistent poison damage.  
**Failure** The target takes the full persistent poison damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 1 to fire and weakness 1 to slashing.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but double the persistent poison damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The [Persistent Damage](Persistent%20Damage.md) increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`, and the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.
