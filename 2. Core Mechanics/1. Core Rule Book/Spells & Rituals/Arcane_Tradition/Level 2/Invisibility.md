Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes [Invisible](Invisible.md). This makes it [Undetected](Undetected.md) to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it [Hidden](Hidden.md) to them instead. If the target uses a [Hostile](Hostile.md) action, the spell ends after that [Hostile](Hostile.md) action is completed.

<hr>

**Heightened (4th)** The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn't end if the target uses a [Hostile](Hostile.md) action.
