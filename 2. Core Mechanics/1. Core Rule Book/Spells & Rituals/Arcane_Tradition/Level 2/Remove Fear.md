__Source__ Core Rulebook pg. 363 3.0  
**Traditions** divine, occult, primal  
**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal  
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 creature

With a touch, you ease a creature's fears. You can attempt to [counteract](Counteracting.md) a single fear effect that the target suffers from. This frees only the target, not any other creatures under the fear effect.

<hr>

**Heightened (6th)** The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
