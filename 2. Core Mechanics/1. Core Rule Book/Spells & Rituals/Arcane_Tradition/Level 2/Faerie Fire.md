All creatures in the area when you cast the spell are limned in colorful, heatless fire of a color of your choice for the duration. Visible creatures can't be [Concealed](Concealed.md) while affected by faerie fire. If the creatures are [Invisible](Invisible.md), they are [Concealed](Concealed.md) while affected by faerie fire, rather than being [Undetected](Undetected.md).
