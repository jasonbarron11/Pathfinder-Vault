You forcibly calm creatures in the area, soothing them into a nonviolent state; each creature must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** Calming urges impose a –1 status penalty to the creature's attack rolls.  
**Failure** Any emotion effects that would affect the creature are suppressed and the creature can't use [Hostile](Hostile.md) actions. If the target is subject to hostility from any other creature, it ceases to be affected by calm emotions.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but hostility doesn't end the effect.
