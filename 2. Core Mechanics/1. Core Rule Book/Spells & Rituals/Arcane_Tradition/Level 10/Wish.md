You state a wish, making your greatest desire come true. A wish spell can produce any one of the following effects.

- Duplicate any spell from the arcane list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
- Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower to which you have access.
- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the wish spell.  
The GM might allow you to try using wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so might be dangerous or the spell might have only a partial effect.
