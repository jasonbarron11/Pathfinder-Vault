The primal power of the world flows through you. You transform into an incarnation of nature, either a green man or a kaiju. Your battle form is Medium for a green man or Gargantuan (30-foot-by-30-foot space) for a kaiju. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. While in this form, you gain the plant trait (for a green man) or the beast trait (for a kaiju). You can Dismiss the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 25 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 30 temporary Hit Points.
- [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level 2/Darkvision](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level%202/Darkvision).
- One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +34, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- Athletics modifier of +36, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of incarnation you choose:

- **Green Man** Speed 40 feet, climb Speed 40 feet;
	- **Melee ► vines** (reach 30 feet, [versatile](versatile)), Damage 6d8+12 bludgeoning;
	- **Ranged** ►** thorns** (range 100 feet), Damage 6d6+6 piercing;
	- **Green Caress** ([Aura](Aura.md), [Primal](Primal.md), [Transmutation](Transmutation.md)) 60 feet. Enemies other than plants must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or become [Clumsy](Clumsy.md) 1 for 1 round (clumsy 2 on a critical failure).
- **Kaiju** Speed 50 feet; resistance 5 to physical damage;
	- **Melee ► jaws** (reach 30 feet), Damage 6d10+10 piercing;
	- **Melee ► claws** ([Agile](Agile.md), reach 30 feet), Damage 6d8+8 slashing;
	- **Melee ► foot** ([Agile](Agile.md), reach 15 feet), Damage 6d6+10 bludgeoning;
	- **Unstoppable** You are immune to being [Immobilized](Immobilized.md) and ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain;
	- **Trample ►►►** You move up to double your Speed and move through the spaces of Huge or smaller creatures, trampling each creature whose space you enter. A trampled creature takes foot damage with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC.
