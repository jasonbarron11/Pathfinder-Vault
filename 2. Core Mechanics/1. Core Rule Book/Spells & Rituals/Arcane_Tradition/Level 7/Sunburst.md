A powerful globe of searing sunlight explodes in the area, dealing `dice: 8d10|avg` fire damage to all creatures in the area, plus `dice: 8d10|avg` additional positive damage to undead creatures. Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes half damage.  
**Failure** The creature takes full damage.  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes [Blinded](Blinded.md) permanently.

If the globe overlaps with an area of magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness), sunburst attempts to [counteract](Counteracting.md) the [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) effect.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The fire damage increases by `dice: 1d10|avg`, and the positive damage against undead increases by `dice: 1d10|avg`.
