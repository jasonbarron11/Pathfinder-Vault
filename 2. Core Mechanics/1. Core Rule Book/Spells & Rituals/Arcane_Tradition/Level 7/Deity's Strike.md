A manifested version of your deity's favored weapon appears in the air above and attacks the target, using your spell attack roll. On a hit, the weapon deals `dice: 7d12|avg` force damage, or double damage on a critical hit.

After the attack, whether it succeeds or fails, divine energy bursts from the weapon in a shock wave. It emits in a 10-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line starting from the target and continuing in a direction you choose. Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). Your target and any other creatures within the area of the spell take `dice: 5d6|avg` damage of the chosen alignment type, with a basic Reflex save. The spell gains the trait of the alignment you choose. If your deity is true neutral, the weapon doesn't create a shock wave.

<hr>

**Heightened (9th)** The force damage increases by `dice: 1d12|avg` and the alignment damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
