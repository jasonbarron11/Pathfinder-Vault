You channel the primal forces of nature to transform into a Large battle form, specifically that of a powerful and terrifying elephant or similar creature, such as a mammoth, mastodon, or anancus. This spell has the effects of dinosaur form, except you gain the following specific abilities instead of the form-specific abilities of dinosaur form.

_Speed_ 40 feet  
**Melee ► foot**, Damage `dice: 2d8|avg` bludgeoning  
**Melee ► trunk** (reach 10 feet), **Effect** _Grabbing Trunk_  
**Melee ► tusk** (reach 10 feet), Damage `dice: 2d6|avg` piercing.

_**Grabbing Trunk**_ A creature up to two sizes smaller that's hit by your trunk is [Grabbed](Grabbed.md). If you succeed at your Grapple check against a creature [Grabbed](Grabbed.md) by your trunk, you can reposition the creature to another space within your trunk's reach.
