You afflict the target with a curse that makes its presence abrasive and off -putting. The target must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check, and creatures they encounter have an initial attitude toward them of one step worse (for instance, un[Friendly](Friendly.md) instead of [Indifferent](Indifferent.md)).  
**Failure** As success, but the effect is permanent.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, and creatures that the target encounters have an initial attitude toward them of two steps worse.
