You send out a ray of colored light streaming toward your enemy, with a magical effect depending on the ray's color. Make a spell attack roll. If you hit, roll `dice: 1d4|avg` to see which beam you cast. If the ray deals damage, that damage is doubled on a critical hit. Any additional traits that apply to a ray are listed in parentheses just after the name of the color.

1. **Red** (fire) The ray deals 30 fire damage to the target.
2. **Orange** (acid) The ray deals 40 acid damage to the target.
3. **Yellow** (electricity) The ray deals 50 electricity damage to the target.
4. **Green** (poison) The ray deals 25 poison damage to the target, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 1 for 1 minute ([Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 2 on a critical failure).

**Heightened (6th)** The damage for red, orange, yellow, and green each increase by 10. Roll `dice: 1d8|avg` to determine the ray's color, using the results for 1–4 above and the results for 5–8 below.

1. **Blue** The ray has the effect of the [Flesh to Stone](Flesh%20to%20Stone.md) spell. On a critical hit, the target is [Clumsy](Clumsy.md) 1 as long as it's [Slowed](Slowed.md) by the flesh to stone effect.
2. **Indigo** (emotion, incapacitation, mental) The ray has the effect of the [Confusion](Confusion.md) spell. On a critical hit, it has the effect of [Warp Mind](Warp%20Mind.md) instead.
3. **Violet** The target is [Slowed](Slowed.md) for 1 minute. It must also succeed at a Will save or be teleported 120 feet directly away from you (if there isn't room for it to appear there, it appears in the nearest open space); this is a [Teleportation](Teleportation.md) effect.
4. **Intense** Color The target is [Dazzled](Dazzled.md) until the end of your next turn, or [Blinded](Blinded.md) if your attack roll was a critical hit. Roll again and add the effects of another color (rerolling results of 8).
