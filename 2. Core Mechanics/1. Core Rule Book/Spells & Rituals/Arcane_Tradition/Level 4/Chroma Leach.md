**Saving Throw** Fortitude

Your hand glows with impossible colors from beyond the stars, and your touch saps both color and vitality from the living. The target must attempt a Fortitude save; creatures with the [gnome](../../../../../../../80-13th-Age-SRD/Races/Gnome.md) trait take a –2 circumstance penalty to this save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 2 for 1 round.  
**Failure** The target is [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 2 for 1 minute and [Drained](Drained.md) 1. The target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if the target tries to use a move action, it must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has the mental and emotion traits.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is permanently [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 2 and [Drained](Drained.md) 2 (although magic such as restoration can reduce or remove these conditions).
