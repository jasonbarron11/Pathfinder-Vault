You fire a beam of blinding light from your outstretched hands. The beam deals `dice: 5d10|avg` good damage. On a failed saving throw, a creature becomes [Dazzled](Dazzled.md) for 1 round, or [Dazzled](Dazzled.md) for 4 rounds on a critical failure.

If the light passes through an area of magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) or targets a creature affected by magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness), radiant beam attempts to [counteract](Counteracting.md) the [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness). If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness), draw a line between yourself and the target.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d10|avg`.
