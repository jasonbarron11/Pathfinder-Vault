You send powerful sound waves through an opponent's body, vibrating its bones and internal organs painfully. The creature takes `dice: 8d6|avg` sonic damage and must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half damage.  
**Failure** The target takes full damage, is [Sickened](Sickened.md) 1, and is [Deafened](Deafened.md) for 1 round.  
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, is [Sickened](Sickened.md) 2, and is [Deafened](Deafened.md) for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`.
