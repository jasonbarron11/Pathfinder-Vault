You raise a blazing wall that burns creatures passing through it. You create either a 5-foot-thick wall of flame in a straight line up to 60 feet long and 10 feet high, or a 5-foot-thick, 10-foot-radius ring of flame with the same height. The wall stands vertically in either form; if you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length or height. Everything on each side of the wall is [Concealed](Concealed.md) from creatures on the opposite side. Any creature that crosses the wall or is occupying the wall's area at the start of its turn takes `dice: 4d6|avg` fire damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The fire damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
