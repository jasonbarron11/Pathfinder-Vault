You repel effects that would hinder a creature or slow its movement. While under this spell's effect, the target ignores effects that would give them a circumstance penalty to Speed. When they attempt to Escape an effect that has them [Immobilized](Immobilized.md), [Grabbed](Grabbed.md), or [Restrained](Restrained.md), they automatically succeed unless the effect is magical and of a higher level than the freedom of movement spell.
