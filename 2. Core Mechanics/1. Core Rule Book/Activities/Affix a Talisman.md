# Affix a Talisman

==[Exploration](../Traits/Exploration.md)== ==[Manipulate](../Traits/Manipulate.md)==  
__Source__ Core Rulebook pg. 565 3.0  
**Requirements** You must use a [Repair Kit](../Items/Adventuring%20Gear/Repair%20Kit.md).

---

You spend 10 minutes affixing a [talisman](talisman) to an item, placing the item on a stable surface and using the repair kit with both hands. You can also use this activity to remove a talisman.

Attaching more than one talisman to an item deactivates all the talismans. They must be removed and re-affixed before they can be used again.
