# Bribe Contact

==[Downtime](../Traits/Downtime.md)== ==[Secret](../Traits/Secret.md)==  
__Source__ Gamemastery Guide pg. 163  
**Cost** A bribe worth at least one-tenth of the Currency per Additional PC listed on Table 10–9: [Treasure by Level](../Rules/Treasure%20by%20Level.md). Doubling this amount grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.  
**Requirements** You’ve successfully Gained a Contact (see below).

---

You offer a bribe to your contact to help the heist in some way. Attempt a hard or very hard Deception or Diplomacy check.

**Success** The contact accepts the bribe and you gain 1 EP.  
**Failure** You believe you successfully Bribed your Contact and gained 1 EP, but in fact the contact informs the opposition of the attempted bribery, adding 1 AP to the infiltration. The GM can reveal that this Edge Point grants no benefit at any point during the infiltration, as befits the story.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but adding 2 AP to the infiltration.
