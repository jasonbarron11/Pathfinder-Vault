You seek out information about your surroundings while traveling at half speed. You use [Recall Knowledge](../Rules/Actions/Recall%20Knowledge.md) as a secret check to discover clues among the various things you can see and engage with as you journey along.

You can use any skill that has a Recall Knowledge action while Investigating, but the GM determines whether the skill is relevant to the clues you could find.
