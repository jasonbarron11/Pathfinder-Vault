# Composition
#pf2e/trait 
*Source* Core Rulebook pg. 629 3.0

To cast a composition cantrip or focus spell, you usually use a type of Performance. If the spell includes a verbal component, you must use an [Auditory](Auditory.md) performance, and if it includes a somatic component, you must use a visual one. The spell gains all the traits of the performance you used.

You can cast only one composition spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end immediately.
