The weapon can harm creatures without physical form. A ghost touch weapon is particularly effective against [Incorporeal](../../../Traits/Incorporeal.md) creatures, which almost always have a specific vulnerability to ghost touch weapons. Incorporeal creatures can touch, hold, and wield ghost touch weapons (unlike most physical objects).
