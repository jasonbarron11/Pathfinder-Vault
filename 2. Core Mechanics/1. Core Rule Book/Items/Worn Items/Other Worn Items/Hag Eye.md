This item appears to be an ordinary semiprecious stone and is typically mounted on a brooch or ring, but the stone is, in fact, an eyeball. This illusion can be seen through with [True Seeing](True%20Seeing.md) or similar magic, and anyone who interacts with the item feels its wet and sticky surface, allowing them to attempt to [disbelieve the illusion](../../../Rules/Disbelieving%20an%20Illusion.md) (DC 19). Many hags claim a hag eye is more effective if plucked from a living, awake creature, but this is likely just a convenient excuse for sadism.

The hag eye produces no direct benefit for the wearer, but allows the hag who created it, or any member of her coven, can peer through the eye using the [Seek](../../../Rules/Actions/Seek.md) action. This has no range limit, provided the hag is on the same plane.

Any damage dealt to the eye destroys it. If this happens while a hag is looking through it, the hag is [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) for 1 hour.

**Craft Requirements** You must be a hag.

## Hag Eye (Stoney)

Item 6
*Source* Pathfinder Release 182: Graveclaw pg. 76
**Price** 250 gp
**Usage** worn
A stony hag eye is fashioned from the eye of a creature, such a basilisk or medusa, with a petrifying gaze.

**Activate** ►► ([Incapacitation](../../../Traits/Incapacitation.md), [Transmutation](../../../Traits/Transmutation.md), [Visual](../../../Traits/Visual.md)); Trigger once per round; Effect You target a creature within 30 feet that can see the stony hag eye. The target must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save. On a failure, it's [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1 for 1 minute; on a critical failure, if the creature is already [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md), it's permanently [Petrified](../../../Conditions/Petrified.md). Touching the stony hag eye to the petrified creature (a single action with the manipulate trait) removes the petrified condition.
