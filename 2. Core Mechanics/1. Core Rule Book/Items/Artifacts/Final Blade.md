A Large or smaller [Restrained](../../Conditions/Restrained.md) or willing creature can be executed by a final blade.

**Activate** 1 minute ([Interact](../../Rules/Actions/Interact.md))
**Effect** You execute a creature restrained beneath the blade. The creature you execute takes `dice: 11d10|avg` slashing damage and must succeed at a DC 45 Fortitude save or be decapitated as though it suffered a critical hit with a natural 20 from a +3 major striking vorpal scythe. 

The soul of a creature executed with a final blade is trapped, and the creature can't be returned to life, not even by miracle or similar magic. A final blade can hold any number of souls in this way, and a sufficient number of captured souls forms a monster called a gray death.

---
**Destruction** A final blade can be destroyed via the rare ritual, [Blunt the Final Blade](Blunt%20the%20Final%20Blade.md).
