When you cast a [References/Feats/Scrying](References/Feats/Scrying) spell by any other means while holding the sphere, you can relay any information you receive in the same way, allowing others to see or hear the target.

The base version of a crystal ball is a sphere of clear quartz, but other versions are made of different stones.
