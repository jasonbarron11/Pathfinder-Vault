[Legacy of the Hammer](###%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Hammer)
`=this.traits`


Your introduction to the criminal life was spurred forward by a seemingly innocuous hammer that provided you with all kinds of innovative criminal ideas. It has since left your possession, but every now and then you hear a faint whisper urging you toward crime.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Thievery](Thievery) skill and [Engineering Lore](Engineering%20Lore). You gain the [Concealing Legerdemain](Concealing%20Legerdemain) skill feat.
