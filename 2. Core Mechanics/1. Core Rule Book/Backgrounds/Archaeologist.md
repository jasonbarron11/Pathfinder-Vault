[Archaeologist](###%20Archaeologist)
`=this.traits`


You've excavated enough sites to know that ancient civilizations aren't lost; they're merely buried and waiting for the right scholar to unearth them and tell their story. You might have worked as a laborer or local guide before learning formal archaeological techniques.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](../../../../../20-Wyrmspire/14-Dragonling-Zettel/Society.md) skill and the [Architecture Lore](Architecture%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Additional Lore](Additional%20Lore) skill feat related to an ancient culture or the history of a culture you've studied (such as [Azlanti Lore](Azlanti%20Lore) or [Osirian History Lore](Osirian%20History%20Lore)).
