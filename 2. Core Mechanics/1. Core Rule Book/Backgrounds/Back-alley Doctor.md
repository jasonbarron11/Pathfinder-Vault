[Back-alley Doctor](###%20Back-alley%20Doctor)
`=this.traits`


You're the medic many turn to when a more official clinic or healer might not be available. You may specialize in stitching up bullet wounds or have a standing, confidential deal with a criminal syndicate to provide your services any time of day or night. In either case, you've perhaps turned to the adventuring life because a former client is unhappy with your work or members of the local constabulary have been asking too many questions.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Medicine](Medicine) skill and the [Underworld Lore](Underworld%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Risky Surgery](Risky%20Surgery) skill feat.
