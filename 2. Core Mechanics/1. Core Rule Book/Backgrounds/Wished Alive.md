[Wished Alive](###%20Wished%20Alive)
`=this.traits`


Once you were a simple construct or inanimate doll, but due to a deeply felt wish, either yours or another's, you came to life, and so you're now a living, breathing creature.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](Diplomacy) skill. Once per day, you can fervently wish for something you could work towards achieving as a single action which has the [concentrate](../Traits/Concentrate.md) trait. If you do, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the first skill check you attempt before the end of your turn to fulfill that wish.
