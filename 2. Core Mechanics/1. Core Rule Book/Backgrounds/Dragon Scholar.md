[Dragon Scholar](###%20Dragon%20Scholar)
`=this.traits`


Dragons have fascinated you for as long as you can remember. The potent power they possess, the long lives they lead, the ancient traditions they inspireâ€”whatever the source of your interest, you've spent much of your life to this point immersed in all things draconic. These studies have bolstered your self-confidence and given you a wide range of methods and tactics you can use to impose your will on others.

You've likely chosen to attend the Call for Heroes as a way to seek funds as an adventurer to afford more texts about dragons or perhaps out of a desire to encounter one in real life.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Intimidation](Intimidation) skill and the [Dragon Lore](Dragon%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Intimidating Glare](Intimidating%20Glare) skill feat.
