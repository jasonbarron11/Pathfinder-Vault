[Scavenger](###%20Scavenger)
`=this.traits`


You've made a living sorting through the things society throws away. You might have scavenged simply to survive, or plied a trade as a ragpicker, dung carter, or the like. While you've left that life behind, you still keep one eye on the ground out of habit.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](Survival) skill and the [Lore](Lore) skill for the settlement you grew up scavenging in. You gain the [Forager](Forager) skill feat.
