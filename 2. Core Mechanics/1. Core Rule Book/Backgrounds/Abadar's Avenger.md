[Abadar's Avenger](###%20Abadar's%20Avenger)
`=this.traits`

Hao Jin really has some nerve for a supposed disciple of [Abadar](Abadar). First, she dares to start a collection of trinkets in hopes of emulating the great [Abadar](Abadar)'s unsurpassable First Vault. As if that weren't enough, she also sets up a contest to give away her most powerful treasures to anyone who can throw a punch! [Abadar](Abadar) hasn't directly told you as much, per se, but surely this kind of hubris can't sit well with your beloved deity, regardless of Hao Jin's own supposed ties to the Master of the First Vault. At the very least, someone's got to check out this shoddy imitation of the First Vault and write a report for the church of [Abadar](Abadar)â€”and you've decided that someone is you.

With or without the blessing of an actual priest of [Abadar](Abadar), you've taken it upon yourself to investigate Hao Jin's "wondrous" vault by winning her Ruby Phoenix Tournament. You read a few flyers about the tournament's home city and joined the first team that could handle your righteous zealotry, but any more preparation would be a waste of time. You clearly have the divine will of [Abadar](Abadar) on your side (but again, no actual proof of this), which is all you'll need to win this tournament and dispel any notions of Hao Jin's ties to your patron deity.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in [Religion](Religion) and the [Goka Lore](Goka%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Assurance](Assurance) skill feat with [Religion](Religion).
