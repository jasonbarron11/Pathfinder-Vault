[Energy Scarred](###%20Energy%20Scarred)
`=this.traits`


Exposure to a significant magical event overloaded you with magical energy. Perhaps you were exposed to dangerous levels of magical energy that left you near death, or it built up over long-term exposure to a powerful source of magic.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be Constitution and one is a free ability boost.

Your innate [magical](../Traits/Magical.md) trait is [primal](../Traits/Primal.md). Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, or sonic. You are trained in a [Lore](Lore) skill associated with the chosen energy (such as [Fire Lore](Fire%20Lore)) and you gain resistance to that energy type equal to half your level (minimum 1).
