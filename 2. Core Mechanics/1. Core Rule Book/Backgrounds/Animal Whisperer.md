[Animal Whisperer](###%20Animal%20Whisperer)
`=this.traits`


You have always felt a connection to animals, and it was only a small leap to learn to train them. As you travel, you continuously encounter different creatures, befriending them along the way.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Nature](Nature) skill and a [Lore](Lore) skill related to one terrain inhabited by animals you like (such as [Plains Lore](Plains%20Lore) or [Swamp Lore](Swamp%20Lore)). You gain the [Train Animal](Train%20Animal) skill feat.
