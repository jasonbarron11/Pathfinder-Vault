[Ward](###%20Ward)
`=this.traits`


When you were young, you became the ward of another houseâ€”boarded, fed, and educated, but never quite a part of the family. Perhaps you had to tend to their needs in return for feeding and raising you, or perhaps you were provided for but disregarded. Now, adventuring is your chance to grow and roam free.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Performance](Performance) skill and the [Genealogy Lore](Genealogy%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Fascinating Performance](Fascinating%20Performance) skill feat.
