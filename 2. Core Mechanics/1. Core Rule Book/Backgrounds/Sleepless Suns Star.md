`=this.traits`


Among your fellow guards who patrol the Foreign Quarter, you're something of a big deal.

Your popularity has also earned you the trust of many citizens of the Foreign Quarter.

Your laudable performance has earned you a transfer to the newly formed Edgewatch in the Precipice Quarter, where you'll put your formidable reputation to good use by patrolling the Radiant Festival and ensuring the safety of Absalom's most vulnerable visitors.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
