[Warrior](###%20Warrior)
`=this.traits`


In your younger days, you waded into battle as a mercenary, a warrior defending a nomadic people, or a member of a militia or army. You might have wanted to break out from the regimented structure of these forces, or you could have always been as independent a warrior as you are now.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Intimidation](Intimidation) skill and the [Warfare Lore](Warfare%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Intimidating Glare](Intimidating%20Glare) skill feat.
