[Hermit](###%20Hermit)
`=this.traits`


In an isolated place—like a cave, remote oasis, or secluded mansion—you lived a life of solitude. Adventuring might represent your first foray out among other people in some time.

This might be a welcome reprieve from solitude or an unwanted change, but in either case, you're likely still rough around the edges.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Nature](Nature) or [Occultism](Occultism) skill, plus a [Lore](Lore) skill related to the terrain you lived in as a hermit (such as [Cave Lore](Cave%20Lore) or [Desert Lore](Desert%20Lore)). You gain the [Dubious Knowledge](Dubious%20Knowledge) skill feat.
