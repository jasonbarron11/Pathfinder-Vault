[Sponsored By A Stranger](###%20Sponsored%20By%20A%20Stranger)
`=this.traits`


You remember the day the stranger approached you to make several peculiar inquiries. You don't remember much about them, other than a large head and a frail body. At first, the stranger's questions seemed odd: how might forgotten history nevertheless shape the present, whether an insect hive mind could be manipulated at a distance, and so on. You don't remember all of the questions, and you don't know why you could refuse to answer some but felt compelled to answer others. The stranger nevertheless seemed pleased with your responses and insisted you would find study at the Magaambya enlightening. You never saw them again, but you're now here at the Magaambya, with more questions than answers about your future.
