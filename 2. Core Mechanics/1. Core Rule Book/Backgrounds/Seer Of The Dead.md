`=this.traits`


You have long been gifted with the ability to see and speak with the departed. This could have manifested at your birth or when a chance encounter linked you inextricably to the spirits of the dead. Their constant presence might feel like a curse, or it might provide you with welcome companionship.

You gain one ability boost. It must be to Constitution or Wisdom.

You're trained in [Religion](Religion) and [Undead Lore](Undead%20Lore). You gain the effects of the [spirit sense](Spirit%20Sense.md) spell at all times.
