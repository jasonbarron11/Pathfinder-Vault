[Scout](###%20Scout)
`=this.traits`


You called the wilderness home as you found trails and guided travelers. Your wanderlust could have called you to the adventuring life, or perhaps you served as a scout for soldiers and found you liked battle.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](Survival) skill and a [Lore](Lore) skill related to one terrain you scouted in (such as [Forest Lore](Forest%20Lore) or [Cavern Lore](Cavern%20Lore)). You gain the [Forager](Forager) skill feat.
