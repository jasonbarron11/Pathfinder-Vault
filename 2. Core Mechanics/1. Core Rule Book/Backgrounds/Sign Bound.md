[Sign Bound](###%20Sign%20Bound)
`=this.traits`


You were born under a powerful manifestation of a specific constellation, and its connection to you is obvious. You tend to feel most at ease while your constellation is prominent and can draw upon your sign's influence from time to time. When you gain this background, choose a specific constellation, such as the Thrush or the Wagon. Your associated constellation determines one of the ability boosts you gain and an innate spell. The list includes benefits for the constellations of the [Cosmic Caravan](Cosmic%20Caravan), but you might have been born under a different constellation and gain different benefits as determined by the GM.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to the ability tied to your sign, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in [Astrology Lore](Astrology%20Lore). You also gain the ability to cast an occult innate spell, as determined by your sign. The frequency with which you can cast this spell is listed below; cantrips can be used as often as you wish. As normal, you cast non-cantrip innate spells at the lowest level available to that spell, such as 2nd level for [speak with animals](Speak%20with%20Animals.md), and cantrips are heightened to half your level. Additionally, once during the prominent time for your sign (such as 12 Pharastâ€“18 Gozran for the Bridge), you can cast your sign's spell without expending its normal use.
