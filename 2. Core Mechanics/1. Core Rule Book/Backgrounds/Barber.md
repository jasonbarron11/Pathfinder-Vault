[Barber](###%20Barber)
`=this.traits`


Haircuts, dentistry, bloodletting, and surgeryâ€”if it takes a steady hand and a razor, you do it. You may have taken to the road to expand your skills, or to test yourself against a world that leaves your patients so battered and bruised.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Medicine](Medicine) skill and the [Surgery Lore](Surgery%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Risky Surgery](Risky%20Surgery) skill feat.
