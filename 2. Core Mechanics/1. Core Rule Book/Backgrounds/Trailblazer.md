[Trailblazer](###%20Trailblazer)
`=this.traits`


Uncharted realms have always intrigued you, and you've explored and mapped large territories in service to merchants, governments, or your own curiosity. Where some see a blank spot on a map, you see the potential for something new and undiscovered.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](Survival) skill and the [Cartography Lore](Cartography%20Lore) skill.

You gain the [Terrain Expertise](Terrain%20Expertise) skill feat with one terrain you've explored (such as forest or underground).
