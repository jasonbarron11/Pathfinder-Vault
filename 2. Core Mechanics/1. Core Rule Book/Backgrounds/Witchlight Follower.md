[Witchlight Follower](###%20Witchlight%20Follower)
`=this.traits`


While in a dismal forest or remote swamp, you caught sight of a string of lights bobbing through the trees.

You stepped forward for a closer look, and then still further when the lights retreated a few paces. Then you remembered the rumors. Will-o'-wisps, rushlights, corpse lanterns—whatever they're called—such evil creatures lead people to their doom. With a supreme effort of will, you broke free from the alluring enchantment, and you've resolved to never let the strange lights of remote wildernesses claim you again.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in [Survival](Survival) and the [Wisp Lore](Wisp%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Terrain Expertise](Terrain%20Expertise) skill feat with both swamp terrain and subterranean bodies of water.
