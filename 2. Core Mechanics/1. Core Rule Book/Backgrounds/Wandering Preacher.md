[Wandering Preacher](###%20Wandering%20Preacher)
`=this.traits`


While you once spoke to a small congregation in a ramshackle church, those days are behind you now. Your church was destroyed, your congregants scattered, and now you meander the lands holding a worn copy of your religious text in one hand, and a fiery conviction in the other.

Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Religion](Religion) skill and a [Lore](Lore) skill associated with the deity you preach for (such as [Pharasmin Lore](Pharasmin%20Lore)). You gain the [Pilgrim's Token](Pilgrim's%20Token) skill feat.
