[Aerialist](###%20Aerialist)
`=this.traits`


Experienced with trapezes, aerial silks, and hoops, your skill is in performing death-defying stunts high above the ground. The Celestial Menagerie skimped on safety devices such as nets and quality ropes, so you also learned to take a fall better than most. After a harrowing near-death experience involving a cracked trapeze bar, you decided to take your expertise elsewhere.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) skill and the [Rope Lore](Rope%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Cat Fall](Cat%20Fall) skill feat.
