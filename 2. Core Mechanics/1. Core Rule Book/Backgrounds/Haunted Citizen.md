[Haunted Citizen](###%20Haunted%20Citizen)
`=this.traits`


You grew up in a region where undead lurk everywhere. This could be a domain as small as a vampire's fief or as vast as the nation of Ustalav. As an ever-present concern, the undead greatly shaped your life. Living with fear became an everyday skill... as did pleading for your life.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](Diplomacy) skill and the [Lore](Lore) skill for your home settlement. You gain the [No Cause for Alarm](No%20Cause%20for%20Alarm) skill feat (Advanced Player's Guide 208).
