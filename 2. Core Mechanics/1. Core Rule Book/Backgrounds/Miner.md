[Miner](###%20Miner)
`=this.traits`


You earned a living wrenching precious minerals from the lightless depths of the earth. Adventuring might have seemed lucrative or glamorous compared to this backbreaking laborâ€” and if you have to head back underground, this time you plan to do so armed with a real weapon instead of a miner's pick.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](Survival) skill and the [Mining Lore](Mining%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Terrain Expertise](Terrain%20Expertise) skill feat with underground terrain.
