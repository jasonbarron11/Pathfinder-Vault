[Pathfinder Recruiter](###%20Pathfinder%20Recruiter)
`=this.traits`


The Pathfinder Society's always on the lookout for talent, but that talent rarely just stumbles into the Grand Lodge. Whether you're professionally trained to encourage new recruits or the [Society](../../../../../20-Wyrmspire/14-Dragonling-Zettel/Society.md)'s own scouts identified your potential and raised you from childhood, you're committed to expanding the [Society](../../../../../20-Wyrmspire/14-Dragonling-Zettel/Society.md)'s roster.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](Diplomacy) skill and a [Lore](Lore) skill related to one city you've visited often. You gain the [Group Impression](Group%20Impression) skill feat.
