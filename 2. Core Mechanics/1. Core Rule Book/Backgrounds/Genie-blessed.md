[Genie-blessed](###%20Genie-blessed)
`=this.traits`


You've sought out a powerful genie and requested their blessing, hoping to increase your fortune. Your wish was vague, but fortune and the genie favored you with a more powerful effect than an ordinary wish, granting you bits of wish-twisted luck throughout the rest of your life.

Meanwhile, other genies of the same kind recognize you as one blessed by one of their most powerful nobles, and might treat you with greater respect or envy.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](Diplomacy) skill and the [Genie Lore](Genie%20Lore) skill. You gain the Wish for Luck free action.



> [!tip] Wish for Luck 
> **Frequency** 1 per day
> **Trigger**  You are about to roll an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check
> **Effect** You wish aloud for success. Roll the check twice and take the higher result.
