[Noble](###%20Noble)
`=this.traits`


To the common folk, the life of a noble seems one of idyllic luxury, but growing up as a noble or member of the aspiring gentry, you know the reality: a noble's lot is obligation and intrigue. Whether you seek to escape your duties by adventuring or to better your station, you have traded silks and pageantry for an adventurer's life.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](../../../../../20-Wyrmspire/14-Dragonling-Zettel/Society.md) skill and your choice of the [Genealogy Lore](Genealogy%20Lore) or [Heraldry Lore](Heraldry%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Courtly Graces](Courtly%20Graces) skill feat.
