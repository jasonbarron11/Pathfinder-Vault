Whether you come from Westcrown or elsewhere, you hold the values of pre-Thrune Cheliax dear. You disdain the infernal government, but you are proud of your country and do not consider yourself a rebel.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](Diplomacy) skill and the [Westcrown Lore](Westcrown%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Group Impression](Group%20Impression) skill feat.
