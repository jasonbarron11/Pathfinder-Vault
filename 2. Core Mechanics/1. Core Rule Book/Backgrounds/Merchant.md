[Merchant](###%20Merchant)
`=this.traits`


In a dusty shop, market stall, or merchant caravan, you bartered wares for coin and trade goods. The skills you picked up still apply in the adventuring life, in which a good deal on a suit of armor could prevent your death.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](Diplomacy) skill and the [Mercantile Lore](Mercantile%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Bargain Hunter](Bargain%20Hunter) skill feat.
