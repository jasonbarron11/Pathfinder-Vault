[Relentless Dedication](###%20Relentless%20Dedication)
`=this.traits`


Recruiters invite many candidates like you to train to be Knights of Lastwall, but only a select few make the cut. Whereas others lose heart, your perseverance paid off.

Your commitment to the cause is so clear, it overcame whatever disqualified your previous attempts to join the new Shining Crusade.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Warfare Lore](Warfare%20Lore) skill, and you gain the [Canny Acumen](Canny%20Acumen) feat.
