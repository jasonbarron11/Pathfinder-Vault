[Royalty](###%20Royalty)
`=this.traits`


You are a prominent member of a royal family. You have taken up the life of an adventurerâ€”perhaps you're a deposed queen hoping to regain her throne, a prince seeking a more exciting life, or a princess on a secret mission.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You are trained in [Society](../../../../../20-Wyrmspire/14-Dragonling-Zettel/Society.md). You gain the [Courtly Graces](Courtly%20Graces) skill feat and can influence commoners in your family's territory, as well as nobility anywhere. If you later gain the [Connections](Connections) skill feat, you automatically have common and noble connections within any community in your royal family's territory and have noble connections in large communities outside your territory.
