[Barker](###%20Barker)
`=this.traits`


You're skilled at shouting to catch and keep the attention of passersby. A few well-timed and forcefully spoken words not only get people to notice you but also engage them to respond to you. You may have previously worked as a crier or in a more formal barker capacity with Mistress Dusklight's Celestial Menagerie. Either way, your ability to bully a crowd is impressive.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Intimidation](Intimidation) skill and the [Crowd Lore](Crowd%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Group Coercion](Group%20Coercion) skill feat.
