[Squire](###%20Squire)
`=this.traits`


You trained at the feet of a knight, maintaining their gear and supporting them at tourneys and in battle. Now you search for a challenge that will prove you worthy of full knighthood, or you've spurned pomp and ceremony to test yourself in honest, albeit less formal, combat.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](Athletics) skill and your choice of the [Heraldry Lore](Heraldry%20Lore) or [Warfare Lore](Warfare%20Lore) skill. You gain the [Armor Assist](Armor%20Assist) skill feat.
