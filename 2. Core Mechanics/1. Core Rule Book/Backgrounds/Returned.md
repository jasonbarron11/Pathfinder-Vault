[Returned](###%20Returned)
`=this.traits`


You died and miraculously returned with knowledge of the realms beyond death and a stronger link to life. Some dead and undead souls might feel a strange, instinctual kinship with you.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You gain the [Diehard](Diehard) feat and the [Additional Lore](Additional%20Lore) feat for [Boneyard Lore](Boneyard%20Lore).
