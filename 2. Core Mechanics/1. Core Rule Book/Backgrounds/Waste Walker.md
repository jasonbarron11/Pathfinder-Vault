[Waste Walker](###%20Waste%20Walker)
`=this.traits`


Whether you grew up in the Mana Wastes or another similarly desolate place, you quickly learned that only the strong survive. You and your family were forced to evade monsters, mutants, wild magic, and worse, as each new day heralded the possibility of a danger or threat you'd never seen before. You learned to adapt to the worst possible conditions and how to forage and survive in a place few others would dare to live.

Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](Survival) skill, and [Mana Wastes Lore](Mana%20Wastes%20Lore) (or another similar [Lore](Lore) skill associated with the wastes where you grew up). You gain the [Forager](Forager) skill feat.
