[Alkenstar Outlaw](###%20Alkenstar%20Outlaw)
`=this.traits`


You're an outlaw whose first crime was stealing the guns from Alkenstar's Gunworks which allowed you to commence a crime spree of epic proportions. You don't know where your road ends, but it's probably going to be a bloody affair.

The life of an adventurer might even be a relief compared to a life forever on the run from Alkenstar authorities and their allies.

Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to Dexterity or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in [Thievery](Thievery) and [Underworld Lore](Underworld%20Lore). You gain the [Subtle Theft](Subtle%20Theft) skill feat.
