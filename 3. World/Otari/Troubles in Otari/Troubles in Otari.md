# Troubles in Otari
![[tamily tandervil.PNG|right|600]][[Tamily Tanderveil]], owner of the Otari Fishery and its associated game hall, offers the heroes an old fish camp to use as their new headquarters. The camp is just outside of town, but several monstrous residents have moved in since Tamily left. The heroes will have to clear out these foes if they’d like to use the camp as their own. These impediments include natural threats, such as wild boars and hungry crocodiles, and more monstrous perils: unnatural oozes, giant rats, and a vile web lurker and its spider minions. The heroes will also have to either befriend or drive away a reclusive, mischievous creature known as a scalliwing and decide whether they want to help a despondent ghost fulfill their grandmother’s final wishes. By the end of the adventure, the heroes will have learned valuable tactics and strategies, all while earning themselves a new home base from which they can embark on further adventures! 

### Getting Started 
If the heroes have played through “Menace under Otari” or another adventure that takes place in town, you should give them a few days to rest and recover after their efforts. Then, [[Tamily Tanderveil]] sends the heroes an invitation to meet her for a light dinner and a round of drinks at the Otari Fishery. 

If this is the heroes’ first visit to the seaside town, [[Tamily Tanderveil]] hears about the arrival of new adventurers and sends them an invitation to her game hall at the Otari Fishery, as she has business she’d like to discuss. 

With a few simple questions around town, the characters can easily learn that Tamily opens the ground floor of her fishery to sailors, laborers, and travelers as a comfortable and welcoming place to gather for games and entertainment. Residents of Otari speak highly of her and, if necessary, encourage the heroes to meet her—having a friend like Tamily is a boon to any adventurer! Whenever the heroes arrive at the Otari Fishery, read or paraphrase the following text to get the adventure started:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The sounds of chatter and laughter spill from the Otari Fishery’s open doors alongside warm and welcoming lamplight. Within, a few dozen common folk gather around rough tables with cards, dice, tokens, and other game pieces scattered among them. A familiar freckled human woman pops up and grins in greeting—Tamily Tanderveil. Her peg leg, a red-and-white striped affair with a bright blue bow at the top, thunks against the floor as she hurries forward. 
> 
> “I’m so glad you came! Welcome! Can I get you something to drink? Snacks?” She gestures toward an empty table in a near corner, and with a flurry of clattering activity, she sets out bowls of fried vegetables, a platter of sausage rolls, plates of cookies, and mugs of frothy ale. Tamily lifts her mug in a toast.
> “Now, everyone knows that a good adventuring team needs a base of operations, right? Your hideout! Headquarters! A place to sleep that doesn’t charge by the night, right? And I have just the place for you—an old fish camp I used to run, right up the road from here. I haven’t been using it since I opened this place up, and I owe you all something big. If you want it, it’s all yours! Just be careful when you check it out, since it’s been empty for a while, okay? No telling what’s holed up in there since we left. Oh, and don’t mind Blue Finley—he's harmless!"

The heroes likely have plenty of questions for Tamily—after all, it isn’t every day that someone offers up a piece of property as a reward. Likely questions and Tamily’s responses follow. You’re free to read or paraphrase the answers to suit your portrayal of Tamily. Be sure to give different characters a chance to speak and interact with this NPC, and avoid letting a single player dominate the conversation.

- **Where is this camp?** Tamily produces a map from a pouch at her side, unrolls it, and shows the heroes the camp’s location. “It’s right here, about six miles down the road.” You can show the players the map on the inside front cover of this book. Reaching the camptakes about 3 hours of travel by foot—see the rules for [[exploration]] on page 61 of the Hero’s Handbook
- **Did you have any monster problems while you were there?** “Oh, sometimes! There’s always spiders, and sometimes they get scary big. Some of the animals in the woods can tear you up if you’re not watching for them. Like, this time of year, there’s probably a few boars running around, and those things are just always in a bad mood.” If the characters ask for more details, Tamily can provide information about giant spiders and wild boars as if they had succeeded at a check to [[Recall Knowledge]].

- **How do you come to abandon the fish camp?** Tamily shrugs. “Well, I closed it up for the season one year, and then while I was here in town, I met a few folks and started up the fishery. Business was booming, so I never got around to cleaning it out or doing anything else with it. The way I see it, we’re helping each other out! ”

- **Who’s Blue Finley?** “Oh, he's harmless,” Tamily says, waving her hand vaguely. “He's a ghost. He were there when I bought the camp way back when, and he just keeps to himself, so I’ve left him alone. So long as you don’t bother him, you’ll be fine.” The heroes might ask questions that aren’t answered above. Tamily answers any questions they have as best she can. She’s familiar with the layout of the camp and the supplies stored there, but she doesn’t know about any of the creatures currently occupying the camp (area B) besides Blue Finley. If you’re not sure whether Tamily knows the answer to a question, you can roll a check for her to [[Recall Knowledge]], using a skill modifier of +8. Once the characters have finished asking their questions, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Tamily grins and drains her mug. “Great, it’s settled! While you’re there, I’ll go take care of the paperwork so you can have the deed and make it all official.” She hops up from her chair. “I’ve got to get back to work, but you’re welcome to stay here as late as you’d like. Play a game or two! Drinks tonight are on me.”

Tamily makes her way back to the counter she uses as a bar in the evenings. The heroes are free to linger in the fishery, chat with the other patrons, and return to their accommodations at their leisure.

### Leaving Town 
The heroes probably want to get a good night’s sleep and gather supplies before they head out toward the fish camp. If they don’t already have suitable gear for traveling—such as bedrolls, tents, trail rations, and the like—they can purchase general adventuring supplies at the Otari Market. New weapons, armor, shields, ammunition, and similar materials are available at the Otari Garrison. Refer to the Otari gazetteer on page 82 of the Pathfinder Beginner Box Game Master’s Guide for more information about the town and the various establishments the heroes might visit. 

Once the characters are ready, they can set out along the road toward Tamily’s abandoned fish camp. Ask each player what their characters are doing along the way. You can show them the list of [[exploration]] activities on page 62 of the Pathfinder Beginner Box Hero’s Handbook and let them choose an activity, or you can ask each player to describe what their character is doing and then decide which activity is closest to their description. You might want to ask some follow-up questions to decide the right activity—for example, you can ask a player who says their character is watching out for danger whether they’re keeping their shield up as they move for safety (and thus Defending) or whether they’re trying to stay alert and give their allies warnings (in which case Scouting is more accurate). 

The fish camp is 3 miles from the center of Otari. If the heroes don’t use any activities that limit their Speed, they can reach the camp in 30-60 minutes. If the entire group Hustles, they can make this journey in less time; remember to use the lowest Constitution modifier among all the heroes to determine how long they can Hustle together. Most likely, one or more heroes will use an activity that requires them to move at half their Speed (such as Avoiding Notice or Searching), making the journey to the fish camp about 5 or 6 hours long.
