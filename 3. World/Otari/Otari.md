# Welcome to Otari 
![[Otari settlement.PNG|right|600]]If you or your players haven’t played “Menace under Otari,” you might not be familiar with the town where this all starts. Otari is a lumber town and trade port with a storied past that was founded by a group of adventurers over 400 years ago. Today, the town is a prosperous community and one of the most influential along the coast of the Isle of Kortos. Though day-to-day life in Otari is much like that of any small town, its skyline stands out due to the enormous waterwheel at the town’s eastern edge, the ingenious and enormous flume that brings lumber down the cliffside for easy transportation. About 1,240 people live in Otari, drawn from all over
the world. While most of these residents are humans, some dwarves and elves also live here. Most of the town’s residents work in the local fishing and lumber industries. 


Though the immense metropolis of Absalom has long dominated the urban scene on Starstone Isle, civilization has always thrived across the island. Otari’s beginning is relatively recent and involved a few false starts along the way. When Belcorra Haruvex arrived in the region in 4230 ar, drawn by a series of sinister visions, the coastal region was practically uninhabited. Here, she built Gauntlight, the keep surrounding the area, and the sprawling dungeons below the structure—without attracting notice. A group of adventurers known as the Roseguard eventually learned of Belcorra’s villainy and slew her, but at the cost of one of their own: a rogue named Otari Ilvashti. 

Having lost both their friend and their taste for adventuring, the three surviving members of the Roseguard decided to retire. They spent much of their savings constructing several buildings and a sizable pier in a sheltered cove south of the site of their final battle. Since their lost friend’s fondest dream had been to settle down in a small seaside village, they named this new village after him. 

For some decades, Otari prospered as a fishing village, though its population never grew beyond a hundred or so. The three surviving Roseguard adventurers lived to a ripe old age, ultimately passing away from natural causes—an accomplishment many adventurers never achieve. 

With the passing of the last Roseguard, Aesephna Menhemes, in 4290 ar, Otari’s fortunes began to dwindle. Within the span of a few years, its citizens had all drifted elsewhere. Otari lay abandoned for decades before a group of kobolds called the Stonescales moved in. When the kobolds started luring in passing ships during bad weather to ambush their crews and steal their cargo, it didn’t take long for new adventurers to arrive and vanquish them.

While the adventurers moved on soon thereafter, their backer, Maklanni Menhemes, remained behind. Maklanni, Aesephna’s granddaughter, conceived a plan to revitalize Otari as a lumber town. It already contained dozens of buildings that only needed to be restored, after all, and the Osprey River remained ideal for a mill and lumberyard. However, one setback complicated Maklanni’s plan—the steep slopes and cliffs surrounding Otari made transporting timber to the ocean difficult. 

Maklanni’s solution was ingenious—she constructed a wooden flume that allowed for the easy transport of lumber from the woods to her mill and, from there, down an astounding loading ramp that extended from the top of the 200-foot-tall cliff to the harbor below. The mill and flume made Maklanni wealthy and revitalized Otari, although it made her an enemy of the Kortos Consortium, which had a stranglehold on the island’s lumber industry. Two other small lumber companies broke from the Kortos Consortium and settled in Otari as well, each paying for use of Maklanni’s invention. 

Today, Otari is a thriving settlement—the largest on the coast between Absalom and Diobel. Maklanni is long dead, but her descendant Oseph carries on the family trade and also serves as the town’s mayor. Unsavory representatives of the Kortos Consortium have secretly infiltrated Otari and seek to undermine the town’s security. However, a far greater threat looms over the city: Belcorra has returned and is preparing to light the baleful fires of Gauntlight once again!

# Otari at a Glance 
Otari is nestled in a coastal valley between two looming cliffs. To the west, the cliffside rises to meet a well-cared-for graveyard. To the east, a fantastic feat of engineering draws the eye—the trestle supporting a wooden loading chute extends down from the clifftop to a loading platform built into the harbor. This ingenious construction swiftly delivers lumber processed further inland at the mill to waiting ships below. 

The people of Otari are friendly and welcoming for the most part, although they tend to react with reticence toward those they suspect hail from Absalom. Trade with Absalom is important, but the townsfolk are proud and feel no need to accommodate visiting “city folk.” People in Otari typically subsist on fish along with vegetables from local farms (primarily potatoes, carrots, and other root vegetables), but more unusual fare isn’t hard to get from Absalom. Coffee is a mainstay and a favorite drink of the hardworking and early-rising residents. 

#### Exploring Otari 
Significant locations in Otari are detailed on the following pages and correspond to the numbers on the map on page 8. Unlabeled buildings are wooden homes whose inhabitants work for nearby businesses or for one of the town’s three lumber concerns. 

Many significant locations end with a stat block that summarizes the site’s name, general function, and level (for the purpose of determining any necessary values associated with it, such as the highest level task available to Earn Income). This stat block also notes the site’s address, wares and services for sale there (such as spellcasting services), and information about the most significant NPC who lives or works at the establishment. The NPC’s initial attitude condition to the heroes is also listed, along with DCs most likely to be useful when interacting with the NPC. 

#### LOCATION SUPPORT 
If a hero adjusts an NPC’s attitude condition to [[helpful]] (which might require completion of a listed task but usually requires successful Diplomacy checks to [[Make an Impression]]), that NPC’s location supports the party in certain exploration and downtime activities.
