This squat stone building houses Otari’s civic guards, who keep the peace and patrol the Roseguard Road, which leads off toward Absalom, to ensure it stays clear of banditry and trouble. Clad in distinctive green and white uniforms, the Otari Guard also serve as firefighters and barristers, switching predominantly to the latter role when they reach the age of 40. The head of the guard is Captain Longsaddle. This elderly but hale man was a veteran of Absalom’s city guard who “retired” to Otari a decade ago. He took up the mantle of leader after its previous captain, Trusk Hanely, drowned in an unfortunate misadventure involving a bit too much raspberry mead and an ill‑advised boast regarding how long he could hold his breath. Those among the guard who remember Trusk do so fondly, for Longsaddle is short-tempered, foul-mouthed, and much stricter than his dwarven predecessor. The town’s jail is in the basement of the building, but its cells are rarely used to hold any criminals other than petty crooks or drunkards.
