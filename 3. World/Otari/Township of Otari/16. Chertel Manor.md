Wrab Chertel is the current patriarch of one of Otari’s three lumber concerns, Chertel Timber. The Chertels are struggling with a combination of poor management, labor disputes in distant lumber camps, and difficulties with financing. Wrab suspects the other companies of meddling in his business and sabotaging both lumberjack morale and equipment alike; in truth, the Kortos Consortium is behind Wrab’s woes. By forcing Chertel into desperate straits and hasty hiring, the Kortos Consortium has managed to place an increasing number of its own agents in Otari’s lumber industry.
