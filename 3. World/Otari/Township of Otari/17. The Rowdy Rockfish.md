Despite its name, The Rowdy Rockfish is the quietest and quaintest of Otari’s taverns. A sign depicting a rockfish with his fins up in a boxing pose hangs above the door of this two-story wooden structure, but within, the calm demeanor of its patrons leads some to wonder if this might be the one tavern in the Inner Sea to never host a barroom brawl. The Rockfish’s current proprietor is a matronly dwarf named Brelda Venkervale, a stoic but shrewd businesswoman who took over the bar after her son Lasda, the previous owner, vanished without a trace. A few locals saw the red-bearded Lasda walking out of town with a hooded stranger carrying a lantern. Over a year has passed, and Brelda suspects that her son is gone for good.
