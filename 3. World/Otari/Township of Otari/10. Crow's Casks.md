A sign over the door to this two-story stone building depicts a group of drunk crows perched on a leaky cask. Crow’s Casks is more than just a popular tavern and brewery—it’s a shrine to Cayden Cailean. Its proprietor, a Tengu  alchemist named Magiloy, gives the establishment its name. If Magiloy’s misspent youth aboard a half dozen pirate ships in the Shackles gave her anything, it was a fondness for unusual alcohol. Now well into her twilight years, Magiloy likes tending bar and inventing new drinks for locals and visitors to enjoy. The two most popular drinks currently are a spiced pumpkin rum and a sour blackberry ale. Of last month’s somewhat disastrous attempt to brew a goblinpepper stout, Magiloy prefers never to speak.

#### CROW’S CASKS TAVERN 
- **CHURCH DISCOUNT EMPLOYER PARLOR**
- **Address** 10 Shrike Street
- **Wares** beverages, meals, alchemical items, potions, oils,
divine scrolls
- **Magiloy** (CG female tengu brewer 4, [[Indifferent]], [[Perception]]
DC 21, Will DC 17). If Crow’s Casks supports the heroes,
Magiloy might hire them as taste testers—a job that’s
quite a bit more harrowing than one might expect. A
taste tester can [[Earn Income]] using Fortitude saves, but
on a critical failure, something they’ve tasted
sits poorly, and the hero becomes [[stupefied]]
1 for 24 hours.
