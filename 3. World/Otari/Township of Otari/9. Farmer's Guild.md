This building and its nearby yards provide stables, auction houses, livestock pens, butcher shops, and a guildhall for the region’s farmers. Otari’s Farmer’s Guild handles the distribution of goods from the various nearby farms and ranches, ensuring that the members are paid well for their toil while saving them the trouble of having to spend too much time on deliveries of goods in town. The guildhall maintains a dozen rooms that are free of charge to visiting farmers, but available for rent to others. The current guildhead is a business-minded halfling woman named Jala Highstepper who maintains a shrine to Erastil in the side yard. She isn’t a cleric herself, and hopes someday to convince a visiting priest of Erastil to settle in Otari and take up the mantle of representing the regional farmers, despite the fact that she has done an admirable job of it herself so far.
