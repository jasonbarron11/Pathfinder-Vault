Looming over the western cliffside and crowned by a grove of scraggly trees that no living person in town can remember ever having borne living leaves, the Otari Graveyard is tended by the Dawnflower Library acolytes. A wooden stairway ascends the cliff face from the library below, but most priests prefer to take the half-hour walk through town and up the easier roads to tend the graves. 

Cremations and burials at sea have become more popular in Otari, so burials in the graveyard tend to be the province of older families who value tradition. While the graveyard itself is spooky and unsettling, it doesn’t have any [[undead]] problems within its boundaries—at least, not until the Gauntlight shines upon it again during Chapter 2!
