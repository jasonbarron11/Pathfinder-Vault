One part open-air farmer’s market, one part log‑cabin trading post, the Otari Market is a gathering place for locals and a one-stop shop for all manner of general goods. Tended by a dour, humorless man named Keeleno Lathenar, Otari Market is open every day from dawn to dusk, with one exception: Keeleno closes the market down on every Gozran 5th in honor of his dear departed wife, Ayla, who was mauled to death 30 years ago. The killer turned out to be a werewolf druid named Jaul Mezmin, whom Keeleno believes remains at large to this day. Keeleno remains bitter and fearful toward druids, particularly those who worship at Stone Ring Pond.

The Otari Market won’t support the
heroes if any of them are known to be
(or profess to be) druids. The Otari Market
otherwise automatically supports heroes who
return Ayla’s necklace to Keeleno along with evidence of
Jaul’s death (see area D14’s Side Quest on page 79). If the
Otari Market supports the heroes, they can stand guard
over the market and Earn Income using Intimidation. At
your discretion, a minor encounter with a cutpurse or
other petty crook might take place during a work shift.
