Mayor Oseph Menhemes lives in the family estate with his wife Emnala, their five children, and a small army of servants. One of the town’s oldest structures, the cross-shaped building is a sprawling affair that’s larger than the Menhemes clan needs. The entire west wing of the manor has been closed for two generations, while the eastern wing has been converted into a publicly accessible museum of Otari’s history. 

Oseph does his best to keep his roles as businessman and politician separate, devoting the mornings to work as a public figure and the afternoons to managing his company, Otari Lumber. The heroes are likely to have much more interaction with the Menhemes family, particularly Oseph’s oldest daughter, Dorianna, in Chapter 5.
