A mechanized treadmill runs from Otari Mill into a wooden flume filled with water from the Osprey River. The treadmill and chute transport timber from the Giant’s Wheel hundreds of feet south to a loading chute, which itself descends to the harbor so the timber can easily be loaded onto ships. The loading flume has long been a draw to local youths who enjoy “riding the chute,” but after a few unfortunate accidents, Klorte keeps a wary eye out for such foolishness.
