Tamily Tanderveil turned her back on what could’ve been a lucrative position as a captain among the Gray Corsairs to retire to a safer job here in Otari— the loss of a leg during a raid on a pirate ship having convinced her that serving as a harbor warden would be a wiser decision for her longevity. The jolly and irreverent Tamily maintains a growing collection of peg legs for various occasions that she regularly swaps out. Every night, from an hour before sundown to an hour before midnight, Tamily opens the fishery’s ground floor to sailors, laborers, and travelers for games, snacks, and entertainment.
