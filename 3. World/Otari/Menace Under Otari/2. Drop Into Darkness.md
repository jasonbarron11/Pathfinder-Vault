![[Map 2.PNG|right|600]]After dealing with the rats, the heroes are free to explore the hole in the east wall of the storeroom. It is big enough for a human to [[crawl]] through with ease. Once the first hero enters the area beyond, read the following aloud:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Squeezing through the hole, you find yourself in a cavern that seems to stretch endlessly beneath the streets of Otari. Who knows what menace could be lurking down here? Up ahead, the passageway ends in a cliff that plunges sharply into the darkness

The monsters that broke into the storeroom used this passageway to break through the wall, but they came from much deeper parts of the vast series of caverns beneath Otari.

#### SKILL CHECKS 
To continue on their adventure, the players must find a way to [[climb]] down a short, slippery cliff. Instead of using combat abilities, the heroes each need to attempt a skill check to see if they succeed or fail. This check requires the Athletics Skill, which is used for climbing up and down walls, ropes, and trees. When a character attempts a skill check, they roll a d20 and add the relevant skill. Compare the total to the Difficulty Class (or DC) of the task to determine whether or not they succeed. As with [[attack]] rolls, characters can get critical successes and critical failures on skill checks (page 5). The cliff is only 10 feet tall, but the surface is slick with moisture. The DC of the Athletics check to [[climb]] safely is 15. Whenever a character tries to [[climb]] up or down this cliff, refer to the table at the bottom of this page to determine the results

#### Rope and Other Forms of Aid 
The players might decide to use rope to help them scale the cliff. They can easily tie a rope to one of numerous sturdy stalagmites nearby. Once this is done, the Athletics check to climb up or down is only DC 10; a character critically fails only by rolling a 1 on the die, and they score a critical success if the total is 20 or higher. The heroes might also try and help each other get up and down. A character helping someone else climb must attempt their own Athletics check to assist. If they succeed, the character climbing gets a +1 circumstance bonus to their check (+2 if the assisting character critically succeeds). A hero providing assistance must still roll their own Athletics check to climb up or down themself.

#### EXPLORING THE DUNGEON 
Once the heroes climb down the cliff, they can continue onward to the next area. There is little of interest in this tunnel, but anyone who looks can find a trail in the dust and grime, making it clear that creatures have come this way in the recent past. Moisture and time have obscured any details such as footprints, however. The mushrooms in the lower part of the chamber are particularly bitter, but edible. From this point onward, the characters are free to explore the dungeon at their own pace. They can continue to press forward, or they can retreat back to the town above to rest and get new supplies. Once the heroes have explored an area, that area remains as the heroes left it the last time they were there. Any monsters left alive recover lost Hit Points, but those that were killed remain dead upon the heroes’ return.

#### Light 
From this area onward, the chambers are completely dark unless their descriptions state otherwise. Characters who have darkvision from their ancestry or heritage can see normally. Others need to provide their own source of light so that they can see. As long as one character is holding a torch, most of the rooms are small enough that the torch illuminates the entire area. More precise rules for light can be found on page 63 of the Hero’s Handbook, should you need them.



- **Critical Success** (The die roll was a 20 or the total was 25 or more.)
The character climbs up or down the cliff, reaching their destination safely.
- **Success** (The result of the check was 15 or more.)
The character climbs 5 feet up or down the wall. They must roll another check to complete the journey.
- **Failure** (The result of the check is less than 15.)
The character makes no progress at all. They stay where they are at on the wall.
- **Critical Failure** (The die roll was a 1 or the total was 5 or less.)
The character falls to the ground. If they were at the top, they take 5 damage from the fall. If they were halfway up, they take only 2
damage from the fall. If the character was trying to climb up and this was their first check, they simply fall [[prone]] and take no damage.
