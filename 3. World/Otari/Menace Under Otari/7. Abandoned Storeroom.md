![[Map 7.PNG|right|600]]This room has a small group of kobolds, small reptilian humanoids. Get four [[Kobold-Warrior|kobold warrior]] pawns and put them on the map near the cage. Read the following aloud.

> This large room looks like it was once a storeroom for a building above. At the far side, you can make out what might have been a cage or cell at some point, but it is now full of crates and barrels. Four lizardlike creatures the size of human children are clustered around the door to the cell, trying to pry it open.

#### KOBOLD FIGHT 
These [[Kobold-Warrior|kobolds]] are so busy trying to pry open the cell that they don’t notice the heroes enter, but the moment someone moves within 10 feet of any of the kobolds, they turn around, snarl, and [[attack]]—have everyone roll for initiative!

#### Flanking 
The kobolds here are cunning foes, using tactics and special abilities (shown in their stat block below) to gain an edge. When moving, the kobolds try to flank the heroes, standing on opposite sides of a single hero. A hero who is flanked has the [[flat-footed]] condition (giving it a –2 circumstance penalty to AC) to all attacks made by the flanking kobolds. 

![[Kobold Warrior.PNG|left|600]]The kobolds have a special ability called sneak attack that lets them deal an extra 1d4 damage each time they hit a hero with the [[flat-footed]] condition. A hero can stop being flanked on their turn by moving away from the kobolds, or if one of the kobolds is reduced to 0 Hit Points.

#### LOCKED STORAGE 
After the fight, the heroes can examine their foes. Some of the kobolds are carrying dried fish stolen from the fishery— clearly they were involved in the thefts, but more fish are missing than can be explained by four kobolds. 

The treasure in this room is in the locked steel cell. The heroes can open this cell in either of two ways. They can use a set of thieves’ tools to roll a DC 15 Thievery skill check to [[Pick a Lock|pick the lock]] — it opens on a success! Alternatively, they can [[force open]] the door, which requires a successful DC 25 Athletics skill check. Inside the cell is a pile of old crates and a few barrels. While most of these contain long-spoiled food and stained cloth, one of them contains a small pile of treasure: 200 sp, a gold ring worth 5 gp, and a beautiful +1 shortsword—a magic weapon! The hero using this weapon increases their bonus to [[attack]] rolls by 1!
