This room contains thick webs and an enormous [[Giant Spider|spider]]. You’ll need the giant spider pawn from the box. When the heroes enter this area, read the following aloud:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The tunnel continues deeper underground, eventually opening into a large chamber. Patches of glowing blue fungus cling to the ceiling and provide dim light. You can just barely make out vast strands of webbing across the floor and walls of this cavern, stretching between stalactites like shimmering curtains.

This fight uses the same rules as the first fight against the rats, but it also incorporates skill checks when dealing with webs and includes a new kind of roll—a saving throw—to resist the spider’s poisonous bite! 

This chamber is home to a very big spider, waiting to ambush anything that wanders through its web. The webs aren’t sticky enough to make anyone who touches them unable to move, but they do slow characters down. Each square that has webbing in it is difficult terrain— terrain that’s particularly hard to move through. Moving into a square of difficult terrain costs an extra 5 feet of movement, and a creature can’t Step into a square of difficult terrain. The spider isn’t affected by its webs and can move normally throughout the chamber. 

When the players enter the chamber, the spider is in its lair in the northeast corner of the room. It does not emerge to attack until someone touches one of its webs. Anyone trying to cross through the room without touching the webs must attempt an Acrobatics skill check to carefully balance on rocks and narrow ledges. The Difficulty Class of this check is 15. If anyone fails the check, the spider senses them in the room and emerges to attack.

#### SPIDER FIGHT 
The fight with the spider plays out very much like the combat with the rats. As soon as someone touches one of the webs or fails an Acrobatics check to balance while crossing the room, call for everyone to roll for initiative— usually using Perception, or Stealth for anyone who was hiding at the time. The spider rolls Perception for its initiative (its stat block appears on page 8). After you have everyone’s initiative results, start the first round of combat with the character who rolled the highest initiative result. Each character gets to use 3 actions when their turn comes up, and when everyone has had a turn, start over again at the beginning. The heroes might avoid this fight by carefully moving around the webs. They might also flee from the spider. The spider refuses to leave this area, retreating to its webbed den in the northeast if all the heroes flee.

> Sometimes challenges offer multiple ways for the heroes to overcome them. No matter how the heroes overcome a challenge, they earn XP for doing so—but only the first time they overcome it! If the heroes avoid the fight with the spider and you award them XP for doing so, they don’t get more XP if they later go back and fight the spider. The first time the heroes get past the spider, whether by defeating or avoiding it, award them each 40 XP.










#### Saving Throws 
Whenever the spider manages to successfully attack a character with its fangs, it injects poison as part of the attack. Whenever a character is subjected to poison, they must attempt a special check called a saving throw to resist its effects. There are three types of saving throw: a Fortitude save is typically for resisting poison or disease, a Reflex save is for dodging away from falling debris or avoiding a deadly beam from a spell, and a Will save is usually for resisting spells and magic that befuddle the mind. 

Anyone who is bitten by the spider must immediately attempt a Fortitude saving throw by rolling a d20 and adding their Fortitude. If the result is equal to or greater than 16, they resist the poison and suffer no ill effect. If the result is less than 16, the [[poison]] takes hold! A poisoned character takes 1d12 additional damage and gains a condition, a special effect that adjusts their statistics as long as it remains. In this case, they gain the [[flat-footed]] condition for 1 round—this means they are slow to react to threats, so they take a –2 [[Status]] penalty to their Armor Class.

#### Ranged Strikes 
The giant spider in this room also has a special ranged Strike that lets it throw webbing to trap a nearby creature. Unlike for a melee Strike, the giant spider doesn’t have to be adjacent to a hero to target them with a ranged Strike— it can target a hero anywhere in the room. Otherwise, a ranged Strike works just like a melee Strike. Choose a target, roll a d20 and add 7 for the giant spider’s web Strike, and then compare the total to the Armor Class of the target hero to see if it hits. 

While ranged Strikes normally deal damage just like melee Strikes, this Web Strike is special. If the attack roll is a success, the target doesn’t take any damage. Instead, the target can’t move out of their square until they successfully use the Escape basic action. The target can attempt a check to Escape using the Acrobatics skill or Athletics skill, or a fists attack roll, and the DC is 17. Each attempt to Escape is a single action. 

If the total result of the check to Escape is 17 or greater, the target breaks free from the webs and can move freely. A stuck hero can still attack, cast spells, and otherwise act normally, but they can’t move from their current space on the map.

#### SEARCHING THE SPIDER’S LAIR 
Once the heroes defeat the spider, the players might think to check the spider’s lair to see if there is anything of value hidden in the webs. Ask anyone who explores the area to attempt a DC 15 Perception check. If they succeed, they spot a wrapped up bundle of bones and dried skin that looks like it was some sort of small, reptilian creature (in fact, it’s a kobold, one of the creatures responsible for breaking into the basement of the fishery). The bundle also contains a few items of value. The first is a shortsword that has a small emerald in the pommel. While the sword isn’t magical, the fine craftsmanship and precious gem make it worth 5 gp if sold. There is also a [[Healing Potion]] that restores 1d8 Hit Points instantly when consumed (see page 52 for details).

#### AVOIDING THE THREAT 
If the heroes are very careful moving around this room, they might avoid the fight with the spider entirely. They might also flee from the [[Giant Spider|spider]], moving past the encounter in this area without defeating it. In either case, the spider remains a threat every time the heroes pass through this chamber. 

In some adventures, the situation changes if the players take too long or rest too often, but this adventure and its encounter remain the same no matter how long the players take in exploring this dungeon. Any creatures the heroes defeat remain dead or destroyed, and any creatures they avoid remain in the same place—potentially posing a danger if the heroes pass through that area again later!
