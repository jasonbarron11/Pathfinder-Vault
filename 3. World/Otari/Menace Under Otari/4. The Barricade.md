![[Tunnel Barricade.PNG|left|600]]This intersection presents the heroes with a choice of which direction to go, and it includes a skill challenge that can affect their encounters further within the dungeon.

> After the web-infested cave, the passageway leading deeper underneath the streets of Otari appears to be mostly natural, but someone, or something, has worked to open the cavern and level out the floor, making the passage easily traveled. A crude barricade made from old wooden planks and part of a barrel blocks the entrance to a side tunnel, while the main passage continues off into the gloom.

If any hero examines the barricade, ask them to attempt a [[Perception]] check—rolling a d20 and adding their [[Perception]]. If the total is 15 or greater, they hear a faint clattering noise coming from somewhere beyond the barricade. The area is totally unlit, but characters with a torch or [[1. GM Screen/Spells & Rituals/Arcane_Tradition/Level 2/Darkvision|darkvision]] can tell that the tunnel opens up into a larger room ahead, with a large rectangular object in the middle. There two ways the heroes can take apart the barricade. They can easily destroy the barrier with their weapons, but this makes a great deal of noise and alerts the monsters in Area 5 of the heroes’ approach. 

They can also try to take the barricade apart quietly by rolling a DC 15 Crafting or Thievery skill check. Their effort removes the barricade whether they succeed or fail, but if they fail, they make enough noise to alert the enemies in Area 5. If they succeed, they avoid alerting the monsters.

#### EXPERIENCE POINTS 
If the heroes quietly take apart the barricade, award them each 10 XP.
