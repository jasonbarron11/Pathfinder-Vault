This chamber contains a number of undead creatures, and it could make for a very dangerous encounter if the players aren’t careful. Grab four pawns for skeleton guards and the [[Zombie-Shambler|zombie shambler]] pawn from the box. When the heroes enter this area, read the following aloud.![[Map 5.PNG|right|600]]

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Beyond the barricade, an old cavern corridor winds down into the earth, ending in an ancient burial vault lit by a strange torch with a blue flame. Alcoves line the walls, each one containing a rotten wooden coffin, while the center of the room has a raised platform holding a stone sarcophagus.

#### UNDEAD FIGHT 
This crypt holds foul undead creatures that rise to attack any living thing foolish enough to disturb their slumber. If the players made a lot of noise breaking through the barricade in Area 4, the skeletons and zombie have already broken free from their coffins and are standing, ready for a fight. But if the heroes were quiet when they took apart the barricade, the undead are still in their coffins, and combat begins when they push aside their lids as soon as the heroes enter. In this case, each undead must use their first action on their first turn just to [[Stand]]. 

Like for the other fights, first ask the players to roll [[Perception]] for initiative. Since this fight is against two different types of enemies, roll initiative once for the skeletons, and once for the zombie. This means they probably take their turns at different times during the round. The skeletons and zombie both roll [[Perception]] for initiative.

#### Undead Abilities 
![[skeleton Guard.png|left|600]] These undead have special rules that affect how they take damage. Both types of undead have immunities that prevent certain types of damage and abilities from affecting them. They aren’t affected by anything with the mental trait, they don’t take poison damage, and they can’t fall unconscious— even from effects with the [[nonlethal]] trait. 

Skeletons have resistances that reduce the amount of damage they take from certain damage types. Each time a skeleton takes damage of a type listed in its Resistances entry, reduce the amount of damage it takes by the number after the type. For example, if a hero hits a skeleton with a longsword Strike and would deal 8 slashing damage, the skeleton would take only 3 damage. 

Zombies have weaknesses, which work in the opposite way. Whenever the zombie takes any damage of the listed types, increase the damage it takes by the number listed after it. The zombie would take 13 damage from same hero’s longsword Strike that originally dealt 8 damage, because of the zombie’s weakness to slashing damage! 

Zombies have one more special ability called slow that represents their ponderous, staggering movements. A zombie can use only 2 actions on its turn each round instead of 3, and can’t use reactions at all!

#### LOST TREASURE 
After the fight, the heroes have time to look around the room for treasure. The torch is a special magic item called an [[Everburning Torch]] that emits light constantly. Although it looks like fire, it emits no heat and can’t be extinguished! In addition, one of the skeletons was buried with a polished shield carved to look like a roaring lion. It can be used as a shield, or the heroes can sell it for 5 gp due to its fine artistry.
