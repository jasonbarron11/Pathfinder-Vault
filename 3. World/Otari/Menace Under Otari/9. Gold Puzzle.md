> The door to this chamber silently glides open to reveal a long room. Two stone statues of priests stand in the corners along one side of the room, facing a towering statue of a man holding out both of his hands, palms up. In front of this statue is a stone altar holding nine golden coins. A voice booms out from the statue. “In my hands I judge the value of all wealth, raising up whichever is greater. One of these coins is a deception. Find it using only two judgments and receive my blessing.” 

Players curious about the statue can attempt a DC 10 Religion skill check. On a success, they know the statue depicts Abadar, the god of wealth and civilization.

#### THE PUZZLE 
The statue and the coins represent a puzzle. The challenge here is to identify which of the coins is fake. All of them look identical and they all weigh exactly the same, but the fake coin is worth less than the others. Explain to the players that when the heroes place coins in the statue’s hands, it will raise the hand that has a higher value. So if the heroesput four coins in each hand and the right hand contains the fake, the statue will raise the left hand. After two attempts, the statue asks the heroes to identify the fake. 

If they fail to identify the fake coin, all the coins vanish and reappear in a random order atop the altar. If the coins are taken from the altar and not placed in the hands, they also vanish and the puzzle resets. Any real coins added to the puzzle vanish immediately, added to the vault in Area 10. The heroes can try again as many times as they’d like. Failing to solve this puzzle doesn’t prevent the heroes from completing the adventure, but it does make the next combat a bit more challenging because of the trap in Area 11. 

If they succeed, the real coins fall to the floor and the heroes can take them as treasure (each is worth 1 gp), while the fake coin turns to lead. In addition, the door to Area 10 slowly swings open, which gives the heroes access to Abadar’s treasure and allows them to adjust the traps in Area 11 to work in their favor. 

When running this puzzle for the players, tell the players they must decide how they want to weigh coins numbered 1 through 9, and secretly pick which number represents the fake coin. If they fail to identify the fake coin and decide to try again, pick a new number (since the puzzle resets). The players might accidentally pick the fake coin without solving the puzzle, and that’s okay—adventurers get lucky sometimes! To make this puzzle simpler, you might want to provide props, like pieces of paper with a coin drawn on each one, numbered 1 through 9. 

#### The Solution 
The trick to solving the puzzle is to split the coins into three groups of three coins each. By placing one group of three in each hand and leaving the third group on the altar, the players can determine which group contains the fake coin. If one hand rises, the other hand contains the fake. If neither rises, then the fake is in the three coins that were left on the altar. The heroes then need to repeat this process with the group containing the fake, by placing one coin in each hand and leaving the third on the altar. If one hand rises, the coin in the other hand is the fake. If neither rises, the coin on the altar is the fake.
