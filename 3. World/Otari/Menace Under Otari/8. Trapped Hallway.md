#### SIMPLE TRAP 
This hallway contains a simple trap that drops stone blocks onto heroes who don’t watch their step! 

When the heroes first enter this hallway, ask each player to roll a [[Perception]] check. If anyone gets a 20 or higher, they notice something strange about the square closest to the northern door, as though the floor tile were a little loose, and suspect that it might be trapped. If they know the trap is there, a hero can roll a DC 18 Thievery skill check to [[Disable a Device]], either by jamming the floor tile or by bracing the ceiling. If they succeed, they disarm the trap and the heroes can move through the hallway normally. If they fail, they can keep trying until they manage to disable the trap—but if they critically fail, the trap goes off and the ceiling falls on them! 

If no one notices the trap, its reaction happens the first time a hero steps on the trigger: the square closest to the north door. When triggered, the trap drops stone blocks from the ceiling onto the heroes, making one [[strike|ranged strike ]] against each hero in the hallway. If any of these [[strike|strikes]] are critical hits, they deal double damage, just like any strike. Afterwards, the trap poses no further harm, and the heroes can continue their exploration.

#### FALLING CEILING 
**Notice** DC 20 [[Perception]] check 
**Disable** A hero must succeed at a DC 18 Thievery check on the triggering square or the ceiling to prevent the stone blocks from falling. 
**Falling Stones** *⬲{ .Pathfinder }* When a creature steps on the square closest to the north door, the trap drops blocks of stone all along the hallway. It makes one ranged [[strike]] against each creature between the two doors. 
**Ranged [[Strike]]** falling block +8, **Damage** 1d8 bludgeoning
