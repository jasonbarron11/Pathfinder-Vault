![[Map 15.PNG|left|600]]This chamber is the den of a trio of xulgaths, which are smelly reptilian humanoids. Get three [[Xulgath-Warrior|xulgath warrior]] pawns from the box and set them together in the center of the cavern. Read the following aloud.

> There is an overpowering stench in this chamber, like rotten fish mixed with oily sweat. The warm, humid air only adds to the foul atmosphere. Unlike the previous chambers, this one appears to be a natural cavern, dotted with limestone stalactites and stalagmites, making it hard to see where the room ends.

The horrid stench in this room comes from the xulgaths and can make other creatures sick. Have each player roll a Fortitude save as soon as they enter the room. Anyone who gets a 19 or better can ignore the smell. A hero who fails this saving throw gets sick and takes a –1 status penalty to all their d20 rolls and DCs (including their Armor Class) until they spend an action to retch.

#### SURPRISED XULGATHS 
The reptilian creatures in the center of the room are xulgaths, reptilian humanoids who dwell underground in large family groups called clutches, fighting others for territory and resources. They’re known for their aggressive nature and their horrid stench—which they’re immune to. 

These three xulgaths are bickering with each other over a piece of meat and haven’t noticed the heroes. Ask the players to roll for initiative while you roll [[Perception]] for the xulgaths’ initiative. 

![[XulgathWarrior.png|right|600]]The xulgaths start off combat seated without their weapons drawn. Until they spend an action to Stand, they’re [[flat-footed]] (taking a –2 circumstance penalty to their Armor Class). They also have to spend an action to draw their clubs before they can attack. Once they’ve stood and drawn their clubs, the xulgaths move forward to attack with whatever actions they have left. The xulgaths fight until slain.

#### AFTER THE FIGHT 
After the fight, the heroes can check whether the xulgaths have any treasure. If they do, they find a small bag tied to the waist of one of the foul creatures. Inside the leather pouch is a handful of strange coins, minted in some faraway kingdom deep underground—the coins show a tower inside a cave on one side and a sinister-looking elf’s head on the other. These coins amount to 38 sp and 4 gp.

#### Passage into Darkness 
Two passages lead out of this room, other than the way the heroes came in. One leads off the map, heading steadily down, deep into the earth. This tunnel leads into the Darklands, a vast subterranean realm deep underground filled with all sorts of deadly creatures and sinister monsters. This is where the xulgaths came from, but it’s beyond the scope of this adventure. 

If the heroes travel down this way, tell them that after an hour of travel, they see no sign of the creatures that broke into the fishery and should probably turn back before getting hopelessly lost. The Darklands are for more experienced adventurers, and the players should explore the surface more before delving into these lightless realms. 

The other passageway exiting this room looks like it was dug recently. This tunnel curves up and around before ending in a thin wall of loose stones and dirt. A tiny hole in the wall allows creatures to look into the room beyond (Area 17). If a hero peeks through the wall, they can see the kobolds in that area going about their daily routines. If they spend time listening to the kobolds’ chatter, the heroes overhear a few phrases, including “when we stole the egg” and “more fish for the pet.” A hero who wants to break open this wall can attempt a DC 20 Athletics check. On a success, they break down the wall! On a failure, the wall remains intact, and the kobolds in Area 17 notice the sound and prepare for a fight.
