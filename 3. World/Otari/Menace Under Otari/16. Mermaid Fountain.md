This chamber contains a devious trap. When the heroes enter this area, read the following aloud.
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> While much of this rectangular chamber is in ruins, the center contains a fountain of pristine water with something glittering at the bottom. In the middle of the fountain is a marble statue of a mermaid, her lips pursed as if she were about to blow a kiss, or maybe whistle. Each corner of the pool has some sort of mechanism embedded in the stones, but the one in the southwest corner appears to be smashed.

#### FOUNTAIN TRAP 
![[Map 16.PNG|right|600]]The mermaid statue in the center of the room is the center of a devious trap. When the heroes enter the room, ask each player to roll a [[Perception]] check—roll a d20 and add their [[Perception]]. Write down these results, because you’ll also use them to determine the heroes’ initiative. 

If anyone’s total is 20 or higher, they notice the trap before setting it off. If not, the heroes don’t notice anything unusual. They can act normally—but if anyone steps on any of the tiles adjacent to the pool, the trap goes off! 

This trap is complex, which means it works like a monster. If the heroes trigger the trap, use the [[Perception]] results you wrote down before to determine their initiative. The fountain rolls Stealth for its initiative. 

On its turn, the statue in the middle of the fountain spins around, shooting a stream of high-pressure water from its mouth. The exact effects are different each round and target random parts of the room. The trap’s Routine entry describes how this works.

#### Overcoming the Trap 
The heroes can overcome this trap in a variety of ways. If someone notices it before it goes off and everyone avoids the squares adjacent to the fountain, they can safely bypass the trap. 

Once the trap goes off, the heroes can try to disable the control mechanisms located at each corner of the pool. If any of these stones are still active, the trap continues to act on its turn, but fortunately for the heroes, the mechanism in the southwest corner has already been destroyed (leaving only those in the other three corners to deactivate). To deactivate a mechanism, a hero must stand in an adjacent square and spend 2 actions to attempt a DC 20 Thievery skill check. On a success, that mechanism is disabled. 

The heroes can also physically destroy the three remaining mechanisms by attacking them individually (using the AC and Hit Points in the trap’s stat block). The fountain, being made of stone, has Hardness. Each time a hero hits a mechanism, subtract this number from the damage roll before reducing the mechanism’s Hit Points. 

Once there are no functioning mechanisms left, whether the heroes have disabled or destroyed them, the trap stops working, and the heroes can continue their exploration.

#### MERMAID FOUNTAIN
- **Notice** DC 20 [[Perception]] check![[mermaid fountain.PNG|right|700]]
- **Initiative** Stealth +10
- **Disable** DC 20 Thievery on each corner mechanism (must disable
all three working corners to disable the trap)
- **AC** 18; **Fort** +7, **Ref** +5
- **Corner Mechanism Hardness** 8; **Corner Mechanism** HP 15
- **Routine** Each turn, the fountain uses 1 action. Roll a d10 and look
up the result on the following list to determine which action
it uses that round.
- **1–4 Single Target** The statue spins about and sprays water at a
single random target in the room. Roll a d4 and count to the
number you rolled, starting with the player on your left, to
determine which hero gets attacked. The spray is a ranged
Strike with +10 to hit. On a hit, it deals 2d6 bludgeoning
damage (doubled on a critical hit as normal).
- **5–7 Corner Spray** The statue spins about, firing a spray of
water at each corner of the room that still has a functioning
corner mechanism. This hits any creature adjacent to the
corner mechanism, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Each
hero must attempt a DC 15 basic Reflex save, taking no
damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, full
damage on a failure, and double damage on a critical failure.
- **8–9 Half Room** The statue spins about, spraying half of the
room with water. Roll any die. If the result is even, it sprays
the west half; otherwise, it sprays the east half. This deals
2d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature in that half of the
room, and each hero must attempt a DC 15 basic Reflex save.
- **10 Full Room** This works just like the half-room attack, but it
targets everyone in the room.

#### LOOTING THE FOUNTAIN 
Once the trap is deactivated, a hero can easily climb into the fountain and get the coins. The water is only 1 foot deep, and while it’s very cold, it’s not dangerous. Inside the fountain are 28 cp, 8 sp, and 2 gp.

> If they heroes bypass the fountain, disable it, or
destroy it, award each hero 80 XP.
