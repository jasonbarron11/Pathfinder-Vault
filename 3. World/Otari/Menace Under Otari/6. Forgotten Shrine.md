![[Map 6.PNG|right|600]]The door to this small shrine is hard to see from the passage, as the ledge is about 10 feet off the ground. A hero must succeed at a DC 10 Athletics check to [[climb]] up to the ledge. When the heroes enter the room, read the following aloud.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The ancient wooden door creaks open on rusty hinges, revealing a ruined chamber. Mold and rot stain every surface. On the far side of the room is stone statue of a giant squid, its tentacles reaching toward an altar in the center of the chamber. The scum covers almost everything, but it hasn’t touched the silver bowl sitting atop the stone altar. The water in the bowl is perfectly clear.

If the players ask about the shrine, ask them to roll a DC 15 Religion  skill check. If they succeed, they identify the shrine as one dedicated to Gozreh, the god of nature and the fury of the ocean. If anyone casts [[Detect Magic]] in this chamber, they sense the presence of magic. 

The water in the silver bowl is pure and clean, but it carries a touch of Gozreh’s magic. Anyone who drinks from the bowl regains 1d8 Hit Points, but they must roll a DC 20 Fortitude  save. If they fail, they feel the ocean’s waves crash through their stomach, which makes them feel sick for the next hour. They take a –1 status penalty to all d20 rolls, their Armor Class, and spell DCs until the hour has passed. If they succeed at the Fortitude save, they feel the power of the ocean surge through them. In the next hour, they can call upon the ocean’s might to fortify themself against harm. This power is a reaction that the hero can use when hit by a critical hit on an attack. This ability turns the critical success into an ordinary success (so the attack deals normal damage instead of double damage). 

Each hero can get the bowl’s benefits once per day; drinking a second time in a day has no effect. The bowl loses all of its magic if removed from this shrine, but can be sold for 5 gp.
