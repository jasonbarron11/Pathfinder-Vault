When you Cast this Spell, roll 1d20 and make a note of the result. You gain the following reaction; once you use the reaction, the spell ends, and you become temporarily immune to lucky number until the next time you make your daily preparations.

**That's My Number!** â—„ ([Divination](Divination.md), [Fortune](Fortune.md)) **Trigger** You roll your lucky number as your d20 result on a non-secret attack roll, saving throw, or skill check; **Effect** You call upon the fortune stored within your lucky number and reroll the triggering check. However, pushing your luck has a price: if your result on the reroll is the same number again, you critically fail, regardless of what degree of success you ordinarily would have received.
