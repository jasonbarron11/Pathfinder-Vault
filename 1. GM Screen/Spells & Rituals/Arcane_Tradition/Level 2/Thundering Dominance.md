You shroud the target in a powerful predatory aura and amplify its vocalizations. It gains a +1 status bonus to Intimidation checks. Once during this spell's duration, it can take the Thundering Roar action.

Each enemy in a 10foot emanation takes `dice: 4d8|avg` sonic damage with a basic Will save against your spell DC. A creature that fails its Will save is also [Frightened](Frightened.md) 1.
