You unravel the magic behind a spell or effect. Attempt a counteract check against the target. If you successfully [counteract](Counteracting.md) a magic item, the item becomes a mundane item of its type for 10 minutes. This doesn't change the item's non-magical properties. If the target is an [References/Feats/artifact](References/Feats/artifact) or similar item, you automatically fail.
