You gradually manifest your spiritual energy into your cupped hands before firing off a storm of bolts and beams that deal `dice: 4d4|avg` force damage to all creatures in a 60-foot line. Creatures in the area must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a critical failure, they're also [Blinded](Blinded.md) for 1 round. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the area. If the line passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level 2/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level%202/Darkness), inner radiance torrent attempts to [counteract](Counteracting.md) the darkness.

►► (somatic, verbal) The line is 60 feet long.  
►►► (material, somatic, verbal) The line is 120 feet long.  
**Two Rounds** The line is 120 feet long. If you spend 3 actions casting the spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you choose to do so, the damage dealt by this spell increases by `dice: 4d4|avg`, and you enter a shining state for 1 minute, causing you to glow with light and deal 1 force damage to creatures that end their turn adjacent to you.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage, as well as the additional damage for the 2-round casting time, each increase by `dice: 4d4|avg`, and the damage to adjacent creatures dealt while in your shining state increases by 1.
