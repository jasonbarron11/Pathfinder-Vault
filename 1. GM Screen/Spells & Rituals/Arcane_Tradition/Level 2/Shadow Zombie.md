You cast a shadow over the target zombie, briefly turning it into shadowy vapor and controlling its movement. While in this vaporous state, the zombie is a [Minion](Minion.md) under your control, gains resistance 8 to physical damage, and is immune to precision damage. It can't cast spells, activate items, or use actions that have the [Attack](Attack.md) or [Manipulate](Manipulate.md) traits. It gains a fly Speed of 10 feet and can slip through tiny cracks.

If the target is already your minion when you cast the spell, it doesn't get a saving throw and becomes vaporous for 10 minutes. If the target is not your minion, it can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. If it's already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a Will save, and the zombie uses the better result.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.  
**Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Failure** The target becomes your shadowy minion for 1 minute.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but for 10 minutes.

<hr>

**Heightened (4th)** You can target a zombie of level 5 or lower.
