The target believes its teeth are falling out, crawling along its face, stabbing into its body, and cramming themselves down its throat. The target takes `dice: 2d4|avg` mental damage and `dice: 1d4|avg` persistent mental damage, depending on its Will save. The target takes a –1 circumstance penalty to Strikes with its jaws or teeth while it is taking persistent mental damage.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half damage and no persistent mental damage.  
**Failure** The target takes full damage and persistent mental damage and is [Frightened](Frightened.md) 1.  
**Critical Failure** The target takes full damage and persistent mental damage and is [Frightened](Frightened.md) 3.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** You can target two additional creatures, the mental damage increases by `dice: 2d4|avg`, and the persistent mental damage increases by `dice: 1d4|avg`.
