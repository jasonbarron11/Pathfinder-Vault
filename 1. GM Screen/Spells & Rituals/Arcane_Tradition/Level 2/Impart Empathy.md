You expand the target's ability to understand social cues that are normally beyond its comprehension. Any creature to which the target isn't [Unfriendly](Unfriendly.md) or [Hostile](Hostile.md) can use Diplomacy to [Make an Impression](Make%20an%20Impression.md) on it and to make very simple [Requests](Request.md) of it. This doesn't render the animal any more inclined to help than it otherwise would be.

**Heightened (4th)** The spell can also target plants and fungi.
