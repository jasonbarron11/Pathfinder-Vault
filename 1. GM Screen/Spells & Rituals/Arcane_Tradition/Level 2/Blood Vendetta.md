You curse the target, punishing it for having the audacity to spill your blood. The target takes `dice: 2d6|avg` persistent bleed damage and must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half the persistent bleed damage.  
**Failure** The target takes the full persistent bleed damage. Until the bleeding stops, the target has weakness 1 to piercing and slashing damage.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double the persistent bleed damage.

**Heightened (+2)** The persistent bleed damage increases by 2d6.
