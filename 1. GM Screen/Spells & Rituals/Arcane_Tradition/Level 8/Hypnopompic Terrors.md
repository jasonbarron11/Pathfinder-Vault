You send a wave of nightmarish visions crashing over your targets, leaving them [Paralyzed](Paralyzed.md) by fear. These visions inflict real wounds on vulnerable targets, dealing `dice: 6d12|avg` mental damage. If you target a sleeping creature, it wakes up as it attempts the save but takes one degree of success worse than the result it rolled on its save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is [Frightened](Frightened.md) 2 and takes half the mental damage.  
**Failure** The target is [Frightened](Frightened.md) 2, is [Paralyzed](Paralyzed.md) for 1 round, and takes the full mental damage.  
**Critical Failure** The target is [Frightened](Frightened.md) 2, is [Paralyzed](Paralyzed.md) for 2 rounds, and takes double the mental damage.
