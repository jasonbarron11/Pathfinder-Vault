The target is overcome with an all-consuming urge to dance. For the duration of the spell, the target is [Flat-footed](Flat-footed.md) and can't use reactions. While affected, the creature can't use actions with the move trait except to dance, using the Stride action to move up to half its Speed.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The spell's duration is 3 rounds, and the target must spend at least 1 action each turn dancing.  
**Failure** The spell's duration is 1 minute, and the target must spend at least 2 actions each turn dancing.  
**Critical Failure** The spell's duration is 1 minute, and the target must spend all its actions each turn dancing.
