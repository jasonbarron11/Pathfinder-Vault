You heat a foe's blood and boil it within its veins. The target takes `dice: 10d10|avg` fire damage, with a Fortitude save. A nonliving creature with blood in its body (such as a vampire) can be affected, but a creature with no blood is immune.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half damage.  
**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [Drained](Drained.md) 2.  
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is [Drained](Drained.md) 3.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d10|avg`.
