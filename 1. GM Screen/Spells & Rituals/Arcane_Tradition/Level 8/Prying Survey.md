You create eight [Invisible](Invisible.md), floating eyes, each about 3 inches in diameter, that scan the area around you, transmitting rough impressions of the environment. The eyes constantly examine and send you summaries of their findings. They are solid and can't move through barriers, and they don't follow routes that they fail to find while [Searching](Search.md). Any damage to an eye destroys it. When all eyes are destroyed, the spell ends.

As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can concentrate on a location within the area that an eye can reach. An eye travels to that location, and you Seek visually as if you were there.

As an exploration activity, you can travel at half speed while continuing to concentrate on the eyes to gain the benefits of both the [Scout](Mechanics/Activities/Scout.md) and [Search](Search.md) activities. With the eyes, you can check everything even if you are traveling faster than 300 feet per minute. The eyes use your Perception modifier. You can have only one prying survey in effect at a time.

**Heightened (10th)** The area increases to a 500-foot emanation.
