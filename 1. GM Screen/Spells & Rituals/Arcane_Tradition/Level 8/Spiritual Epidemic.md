You curse the target, sapping its spirit and leaving a contagious trap in its essence. The target must attempt a Will save. Any creature that casts a divine or occult spell on the target while it's affected is targeted by spiritual epidemic and must also attempt a Will save. The curse continues to spread in this way.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 2 and [Stupefied](Stupefied.md) 2 for 1 round.  
**Failure** The target is [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 2 and [Stupefied](Stupefied.md) 2 for 1 minute and [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 1 and [Stupefied](Stupefied.md) 1 permanently.  
**Critical Failure** The target is [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 3 and [Stupefied](Stupefied.md) 3 for 1 minute and [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 2 and [Stupefied](Stupefied.md) 2 permanently.
