You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity. Creatures are [Dazzled](Dazzled.md) while inside the pattern.

In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a [Seek](Seek.md) or [Interact](Interact.md) action on the pattern. A creature currently [Blinded](Blinded.md) by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Failure** The creature is [Blinded](Blinded.md) by the pattern. If it exits the pattern, it can attempt a new save to recover from the [Blinded](Blinded.md) condition at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.  
**Critical Failure** The creature is [Blinded](Blinded.md) for 1 minute.
