Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill any bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the land, or Climbing or Swimming within the creepers, takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once per round, you can make a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of creepers by using a single action, which has the [Concentrate](Concentrate.md) trait.

This vine has a 15-foot reach. Make a melee spell attack roll against the target; on a success, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it [Immobilized](Immobilized.md) for 1 round or until the creature [Escapes](Escape.md) (against your spell DC), whichever comes first.
