You necrotize part of a creature's body, harming it and debilitating it as its body putrefies, mimicking the natural process of decay. The target takes `dice: 12d6|avg` negative damage and one of the following debilitations; roll `dice: 1d4|avg` to randomly determine which. The effects depend on its Fortitude save.

1. **Bones** The target's bones necrotize and become spongy and weak, giving it weakness 3 to bludgeoning damage.
2. **Joints** The target's joints necrotize, making its movements ungainly and [Clumsy](Clumsy.md). It becomes [Clumsy](Clumsy.md) 1.
3. **Legs** The target's legs necrotize, as well as any other limbs associated with forms of movement, making it harder for the creature to move. The target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.
4. **Muscles** The target's muscles necrotize, rotting away. The target becomes [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 1.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half damage and the debilitation lasts until the end of your next turn.  
**Failure** The target takes full damage and the debilitation lasts for 1 minute.  
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, and you can pick a second debilitation to apply, in addition to the one you rolled randomly. Both debilitations last for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`.
