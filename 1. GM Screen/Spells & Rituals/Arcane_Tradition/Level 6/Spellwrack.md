You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes `dice: 2d12|avg` persistent force damage. Each time it takes persistent force damage from spellwrack, it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful Arcana check against your spell DC can help the target recover from the [Persistent Damage](Persistent%20Damage.md); the curse and the [Persistent Damage](Persistent%20Damage.md) end after 1 minute.  
**Failure** As success, but the curse and [Persistent Damage](Persistent%20Damage.md) do not end on their own.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the persistent force damage is `dice: 4d12|avg`.
