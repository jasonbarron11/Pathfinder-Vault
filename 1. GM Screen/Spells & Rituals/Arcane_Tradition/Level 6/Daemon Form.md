You infuse yourself with the corrupting death and pure malevolence of Abaddon, transforming into a Large daemon battle form. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell you choose either ceustodaemon, leukodaemon, meladaemon, or piscodaemon. The battle form is Medium if you choose ceustodaemon. While in this form, you gain the [Daemon](Daemon.md) and [Fiend](Fiend.md) traits. You have hands in this battle form and can use manipulate actions. You can Dismiss the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of the form that you choose:

- AC = 21 + your level. Ignore your armor check's penalty and Speed reduction.
- 15 temporary Hit Points and weakness 5 to good.
- A +2 status bonus to all saving throws against death effects.
- Resistance 10 to poison.
- [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level 2/Darkvision](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level%202/Darkvision).
- One or more attacks specific to the battle form you use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +21, and you use the listed damage.
