You transform into an avatar of your deity, assuming a Huge battle form. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost. You have hands in this battle form and can take manipulate actions. You can Dismiss this spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which deity's battle form you assume:

- AC = 25 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 30 temporary Hit Points.
- [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level 2/Darkvision](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level%202/Darkvision).
- One or more attacks specific to your deity's battle form, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +33, and you use the listed damage. Melee attacks are Strength based (for the purposes of the [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) condition, for example) unless they have the finesse trait, and all ranged attacks are Dexterity based. Attacks that deal positive or negative damage don't heal creatures.
- Athletics modifier of +35, unless your own is higher.

You also gain the specific abilities listed for your deity below:
