You request a direct intercession from the natural world. Nature always refuses unnatural requests and might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its character) than the one you asked for. A primal phenomenon spell can do any of the following things.

- Duplicate any spell from the primal list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
- Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower to which you have access.
- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the [Wish](Wish.md) spell.  
At the GM's discretion, you can try to use primal phenomenon to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.
