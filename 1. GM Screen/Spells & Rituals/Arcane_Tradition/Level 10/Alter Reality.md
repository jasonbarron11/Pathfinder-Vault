You use your occult lore and the power of your mind to manipulate the spiritual multiverse, resulting in any of the following effects:

- Duplicate any spell from the [Occult](Occult.md) list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
- Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower to which you have access.
- Produce any effect whose power is equivalent to any occult spell 9th level or lower, or non-occult spell 7th level or lower.
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the wish spell  
At the GM's discretion, you can try to produce greater effects, but this is dangerous and the spell may have only a partial effect.
