You create an echo of a powerful poltergeist, temporarily anchoring it to the area to terrorize and harm any opponents foolish enough to remain in the area. Because the poltergeist is a manifestation and is not truly present, it can't be attacked or hurt; it remains [Invisible](Invisible.md) unless otherwise stated. When you Cast the Spell, and the first time you Sustain it on subsequent rounds, the poltergeist creates your choice of one of the following effects.

- **Deathly Assault** ([Negative](Negative.md)) The poltergeist focuses on one creature in the area and flies through that creature's space, dealing `dice: 4d10|avg` negative damage (basic Fortitude save).
- **Frighten** ([Emotion](Emotion.md), [Fear](Fear.md), [Mental](Mental.md)) The poltergeist becomes visible, appearing as a skeletal, ghostlike humanoid. Creatures in the area must attempt a Will save, becoming [Frightened](Frightened.md) 2 on a failure.
- **Telekinetic Storm** ([Force](Force.md)) The poltergeist hurls debris and quasi-real objects around in the area. All creatures in the area take `dice: 4d8|avg` force damage (basic Reflex save).

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The damage of the deathly assault effect increases by `dice: 1d10|avg`, and the damage of the telekinetic storm effect increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`.
