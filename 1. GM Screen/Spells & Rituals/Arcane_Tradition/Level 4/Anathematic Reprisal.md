You punish a creature that transgresses against your deity, drawing upon the anguish you feel upon seeing one of your deity's anathema committed.

You can cast this spell only when a creature actively commits a unique act of anathema. For example, if creating undead were anathema to your deity, you could use anathematic reprisal on a necromancer who had just created undead in front of you, but not on an undead creature just for existing.

You deal `dice: 4d6|avg` mental damage to the target, but a basic Will save can reduce this damage. If it fails, it is also [Stupefied](Stupefied.md) 1 for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
