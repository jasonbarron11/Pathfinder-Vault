Extending a finger, you fire a beam of negative energy that weakens the life force of any creature it touches. Each living creature in the line must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes `dice: 2d8|avg` persistent negative damage.  
**Failure** The creature takes `dice: 4d8|avg` persistent negative damage and becomes [Drained](Drained.md) 1.  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes `dice: 4d8|avg` persistent negative damage and becomes [Drained](Drained.md) 2 and [Doomed](Doomed.md) 1.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The persistent negative damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg` on a success, or by `dice: 2d8|avg` on a failure or critical failure.
