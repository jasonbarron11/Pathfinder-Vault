You surround yourself in holy light that restores the living and rebuffs undead. You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light to the next 30 feet. Living creatures that begin their turn adjacent to you recover `dice: 2d4|avg` Hit Points. Undead creatures that begin their turn adjacent to you take `dice: 4d4|avg` positive damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The healing increases by `dice: 1d4|avg`, and the damage to undead increases by `dice: 2d4|avg`.
