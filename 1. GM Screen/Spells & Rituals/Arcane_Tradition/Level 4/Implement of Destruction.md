You solemnly declare that the target weapon will bring death to a foe, implanting an irrational fear of the weapon into the target enemy. This link echoes at the forefront of the enemy's mind, forming a looming sense of omnipresent dread. The effect is based on the target enemy's Will save.

**Critical Success** The target enemy is unaffected.  
**Success** The target weapon deals an additional `dice: 2d6|avg` mental damage the first time it hits the target enemy before the end of the spell's duration.  
**Failure** The target weapon deals an additional `dice: 2d6|avg` persistent mental damage to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is [Doomed](Doomed.md) 1 for as long as it takes this persistent mental damage.  
**Critical Failure** The target weapon deals an additional 4d6 persistent mental damage to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is [Doomed](Doomed.md) 1.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** Increase the mental damage by `dice: 1d6|avg` on a success, and increase the persistent mental damage by `dice: 1d6|avg` on a failure or by `dice: 2d6|avg` on a critical failure.
