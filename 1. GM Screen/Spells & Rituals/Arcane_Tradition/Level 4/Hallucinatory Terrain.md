You create an illusion that causes natural terrain to look, sound, feel, and smell like a different kind of terrain. This doesn't disguise any structures or creatures in the area.

Any creature that touches the illusion or uses the [Seek](Seek.md) action to examine it can attempt to [disbelieve your illusion](Disbelieving%20an%20Illusion.md).
