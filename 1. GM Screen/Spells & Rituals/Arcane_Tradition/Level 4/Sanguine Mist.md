You unleash a cloud of foul, blood-sucking fog that drains the vitality from the living to bolster your own. Each living creature in the area when you Cast the Spell, aside from you, takes `dice: 6d6|avg` negative damage with a basic Fortitude save. Creatures in the area are [Concealed](Concealed.md), and all creatures outside the cloud become [Concealed](Concealed.md) to creatures within it.

The first time each round you Sustain this Spell on subsequent turns, living creatures in the area take an additional `dice: 2d6|avg` negative damage with another basic Fortitude save. You also gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage a single creature took when you Sustained the spell this turn; calculate these temporary Hit Points using the creature that took the most damage. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg` and the secondary damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
