Memories of a past life that seem incredibly real (and may even be) overwhelm the target’s mind. This is especially disorienting for undead and creatures that have lived a previous life (such as celestials, fiends, monitors, and many other extraplanar creatures); if such creatures roll a critical success on their save, they get a success instead, and if they roll a failure, they get a critical failure instead.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature is [Slowed](Slowed.md) 1 for 1 round.  
**Failure** The target is [Slowed](Slowed.md) 1 for 1 minute and babbles about the visions, possibly providing information about what they saw.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is also [Stunned](Stunned.md) 3.
