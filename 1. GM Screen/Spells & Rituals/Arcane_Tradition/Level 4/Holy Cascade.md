You call upon sacred energy to amplify a vial of holy water, tossing it an incredible distance. It explodes in an enormous burst that deals `dice: 3d6|avg` bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area from the cascade of water. The water deals an additional `dice: 6d6|avg` positive damage to undead and `dice: 6d6|avg` good damage to fiends.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`, and the additional positive and good damage each increase by `dice: 2d6|avg`.
