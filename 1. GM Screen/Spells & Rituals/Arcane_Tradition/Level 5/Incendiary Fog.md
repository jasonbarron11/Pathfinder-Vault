You summon a cloud of flammable black dust. The cloud functions as [Obscuring Mist](Obscuring%20Mist.md). If any open flame or fire effect is within the spell's area when it's cast, or later enters or occurs within the area, the cloud ignites. Creatures in the cloud take `dice: 10d6|avg` fire damage (basic Reflex save), and the spell ends.
