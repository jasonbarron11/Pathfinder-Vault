You supernaturally rip the spirit from a living creature's body, dooming the target to pain and death. The target takes `dice: 5d6|avg` negative damage, depending on its basic Fortitude save, and is [Drained](Drained.md) 1 if it fails its save. The spell's effect is based on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.

► (somatic) The spell targets one living creature in range.  
►► (somatic, verbal) The spell targets one living creature in range and the damage is `dice: 10d6|avg` negative instead of `dice: 5d6|avg`.  
►►► (material, somatic, verbal) The spell targets all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`, or by `dice: 2d6|avg` for the 2-action version.
