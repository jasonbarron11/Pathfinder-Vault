You ward the target item against those who would steal it. When a creature attempts to take the target into its possession, it takes `dice: 8d8|avg` mental damage and is [Doomed](Doomed.md), depending on the result of its Will save. The spell then ends. You can choose up to 10 creatures when you cast this spell; if you do, those creatures can take the target item without triggering the ward. You can only have one bandit's doom active at a time. If you cast the spell again, the newer casting supersedes the older.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes half damage and is [Doomed](Doomed.md) 1.  
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [Doomed](Doomed.md) 2.  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [Doomed](Doomed.md) 3.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by `dice: 2d8|avg`.
