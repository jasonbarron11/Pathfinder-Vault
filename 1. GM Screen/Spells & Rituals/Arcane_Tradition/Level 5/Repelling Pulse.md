You unleash a powerful pulse of telekinetic power, and the pulse violently hurls creatures away from you. Each creature in the area takes `dice: 7d10|avg` force damage depending on its Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes half damage.  
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [pushed](Forced%20Movement.md) 10 feet away from you.  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage. The creature is [pushed](Forced%20Movement.md) 20 feet away from you and is then knocked [Prone](Prone.md).

<hr>
**Heightened (+2)** The force damage increases by `dice: 2d10|avg`, and the distance the target is moved on a failure and critical failure increases by 5 feet.
