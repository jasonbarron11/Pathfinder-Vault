Your blessing revives a creature at the moment of its death. You prevent the target from [Dying](Dying.md) and restore Hit Points to the target equal to `dice: 4d8|avg` plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You can't use breath of life if the triggering effect was disintegrate or a death effect.
