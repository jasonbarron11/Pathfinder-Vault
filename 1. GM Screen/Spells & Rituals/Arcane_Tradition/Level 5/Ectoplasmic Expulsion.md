You call upon tendrils of ephemeral ectoplasm to pass through the target and carry away a harmful psychic affliction. You immediately attempt to [counteract](Counteracting.md) a single effect on the target with the emotion or [References/Feats/possession](References/Feats/possession) trait, or an effect giving the target the [Controlled](Controlled.md) or [Fascinated](Fascinated.md) condition. If you fail to [counteract](Counteracting.md) the effect, you nevertheless set up a resonance that allows the target to more ably escape the effect on its own; for the next hour, the target gains a +2 status bonus to Will saves to shrug off the effect you failed to [counteract](Counteracting.md) (such as Will saves to shake off control by the [Possession](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level%207/Possession) spell).
