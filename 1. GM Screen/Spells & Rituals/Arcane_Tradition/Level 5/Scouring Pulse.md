You inundate the area with concentrated positive energy, which scours away the stain of undeath. Each creature in the area takes `dice: 6d8|avg` positive damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save. Creatures that fail the save also take `dice: 1d8|avg` persistent positive damage. Creatures that take persistent positive damage from scouring pulse are wreathed in a heatless halo of light. They emit bright light in a 5-foot radius preventing them from being [Concealed](Concealed.md); if the creature is [Invisible](Invisible.md), they're [Concealed](Concealed.md) while affected by scouring pulse, rather than being [Undetected](Undetected.md).

<hr>

**Heightened (8th)** The positive damage increases to `dice: 9d8|avg` damage, and the persistent positive damage increases to `dice: 2d8|avg`. Creatures remain suffused in light for `dice: 1d4|avg` additional rounds after removing the persistent positive damage.
