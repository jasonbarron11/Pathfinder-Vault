You utter an arcane word of power that can make the target [Blinded](Blinded.md) upon hearing it. Once targeted, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. The effect of the spell depends on the target's level.

**11th or Lower** The target is [Blinded](Blinded.md) permanently.  
**12th–13th** The target is [Blinded](Blinded.md) for `dice: 1d4|avg` minutes.  
**14th or Higher** The target is [Dazzled](Dazzled.md) for 1 minute.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The levels at which each outcome applies increase by 2.
