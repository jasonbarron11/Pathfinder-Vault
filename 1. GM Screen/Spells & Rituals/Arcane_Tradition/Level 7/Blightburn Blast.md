You channel a blast of powerful blightburn radiation from your hands. You deal `dice: 4d6|avg` poison damage to creatures in the area. Creatures who fail their save are afflicted with stage 1 of blightburn sickness (on a critical failure, the creature moves immediately to stage 2). The level of [Blightburn Sickness](Blightburn%20Sickness.md) caused by this spell is equal to twice the spell's level, and the disease's save DC uses the caster's DC.
