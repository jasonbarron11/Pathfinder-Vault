You spin illusions of flying shadows throughout the area. The shadows strike and cavort, harming your foes and blocking their vision with twisting shadow. Enemies in the area when you Cast the Spell take `dice: 6d8|avg` bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, with a basic Reflex or Will save, as shadows explode into being. You choose the damage type when you Cast the Spell, and each creature chooses the type of save it attempts before it rolls the save. The shadows then persist in the area for 1 minute, dealing `dice: 3d8|avg` damage of the type you chose to any enemy that ends its turn in the area. All creatures are [Concealed](Concealed.md) to enemies in the area, as the illusory shadows swarm over them and block light.

A creature that spends an action to Seek or otherwise interact with the shadow raid can attempt a Perception check to disbelieve it. On a success, the creature halves the damage it takes from the shadows, and the shadows no longer impede its vision. These benefits last until the spell ends.

<hr>

**Heightened (9th)** The initial damage increases by `dice: 2d8|avg`, and the damage to a creature that ends its turn in the area increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`.
