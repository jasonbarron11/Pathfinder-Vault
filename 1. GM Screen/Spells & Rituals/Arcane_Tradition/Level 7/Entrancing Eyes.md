Your eyes glow with an entrancing radiance that captivates those who meet your gaze. Any creature that ends its turn within the emanation must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and becomes immune to this particular casting of the spell.  
**Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [Stupefied](Stupefied.md) 2 and [Fascinated](Fascinated.md).  
**Critical Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [Stupefied](Stupefied.md) 4, [Fascinated](Fascinated.md), and can't take reactions. In addition, all creatures and objects other than you are [Concealed](Concealed.md) from the target.

During any round you Sustain the Spell, you can use a single action, which has the manipulate trait, to focus your entrancing eyes on a single creature you can see within 30 feet. This creature must immediately make a Will save against the spell as if it were ending its turn in the emanation. If the creature was already [Fascinated](Fascinated.md) by your entrancing eyes before its save, a failed save causes it to be [Paralyzed](Paralyzed.md) for 1 round. You can’t use this action to focus on the same creature more than once per round.
