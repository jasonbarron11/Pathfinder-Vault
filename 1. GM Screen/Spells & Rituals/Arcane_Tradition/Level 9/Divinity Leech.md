You disrupt the connection between a divine caster or deific servitor and their deity, blocking their use of divine power. If the target fails its save, it is [Fatigued](Fatigued.md). For the spell's duration, whenever the target casts a divine spell, you regain `dice: 6d6|avg` HP and the target must attempt another Will save with the following effects.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** Each target of the divine spell has an outcome one degree of success better than the result it rolled.  
**Failure** The divine spell is lost and target is [Stunned](Stunned.md) 1.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [Stunned](Stunned.md) for 1 round.
