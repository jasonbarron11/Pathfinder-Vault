You crush the target by causing it to collapse in on itself, dealing 75 damage. The first time each round you Sustain the Spell, you must choose a new target to be subject to the same effect; the same creature can never be targeted more than once with a single casting of this spell. You also can't affect more than one creature per turn with implosion. You can't target a creature that's [Incorporeal](Incorporeal.md), gaseous, or liquid, or otherwise lacking a solid form.
