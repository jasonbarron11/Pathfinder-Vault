You purify some dirt or mud into a pliable, claylike plaster that can aid in clotting and healing. This restorative substance can be used in lieu of healer's tools for Medicine checks to [Administer First Aid](Administer-First-Aid.md) or [Treat Wounds](Treat%20Wounds.md). If the plaster isn't used within the spell's duration, or if you Cast the Spell again before using the plaster, it reverts to being normal non-magical earth.

__Heightened (3rd)__ The plaster grants anyone using it to Administer First Aid or Treat Wounds a +1 item bonus to the Medicine check.
