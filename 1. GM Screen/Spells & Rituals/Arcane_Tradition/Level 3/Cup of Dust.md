You curse the target with a thirst no drink can quench. You can Dismiss the spell. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 1 hour.  
**Success** The creature is [Fatigued](Fatigued.md) for 1 round.  
**Failure** The creature is immediately afflicted by thirst as if it hadn’t had a drink in days. It becomes [Fatigued](Fatigued.md) and takes `dice: 1d4|avg` damage each hour that can’t be healed until it quenches its thirst. No amount of drinking can quench the creature’s thirst during the spell’s duration.  
**Critical Failure** As failure but the creature takes `dice: 2d4|avg` damage each hour, twice as much as usual for thirst.

<hr>

**Heightened (+3)** The thirst becomes more unbearable, increasing the damage each hour by `dice: 1d4|avg`, or by `dice: 2d4|avg` on a critical failure.
