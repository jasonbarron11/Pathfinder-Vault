__Source__ Pathfinder The Show Must Go On pg. 79  
**Traditions** arcane, primal  
**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal  
**Range** 60 feet; **Area** 20-foot burst  
**Duration** until the start of your next turn

You issue a blast of sudden wind that ripples outward from the center of the burst. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, scatters objects of light Bulk or less, and pushes unsecured objects of 1 Bulk or less 5 feet away from the spell’s origin point. Each Medium or smaller creature in the area when you Cast the Spell or that moves into spell’s area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Failure** The creature is knocked [Prone](Prone.md). If the creature was Flying, it gets a critical failure instead.  
**Critical Failure** The creature is [pushed](Forced%20Movement.md) 30 feet away from the center of the burst, is knocked [Prone](Prone.md), and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
