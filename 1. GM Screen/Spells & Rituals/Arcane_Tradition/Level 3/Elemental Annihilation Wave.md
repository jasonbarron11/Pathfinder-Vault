You draw elemental power from your surroundings, and combining it with your own magical energy, unleash a wave of utter destruction and swirling colors that deals `dice: 1d6|avg` fire damage and `dice: 3d6|avg` bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the area and other parameters.

►► (somatic, verbal) The spell is a 30-foot cone.  
 ►►► (material, somatic, verbal) The spell is a 30-foot cone. On a failed saving throw, creatures are [pushed](Forced%20Movement.md) 5 feet away from you, and on a critical failure they are [pushed](Forced%20Movement.md) 10 feet away and are knocked [Prone](Prone.md).  
**Two Rounds** If you spend 3 actions Casting the Spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you do, the spell is as 3 actions, but the area is a 60-foot cone, and for 1 round, the elements linger in the cone, racing off into the distance and making approaching you difficult, with the effects of gust of wind.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`, and the distance that enemies are [pushed](Forced%20Movement.md) back if you spent 3 actions or 2 rounds increases by 5 feet on a failed save and 10 feet on a critical failure.
