You curse the target with rapid aging or erosion. The effect depends on whether the target is an object, a construct, or a living creature. Artifacts, along with objects and constructs made of precious materials (as determined by the GM), are immune.

- **Construct** The construct takes `dice: 4d6|avg` damage (basic Fortitude save). On a failure, for 1 hour the construct is [Clumsy](Clumsy.md) 1, is [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 1, and can't be Repaired, and the curse attempts to [counteract](Counteracting.md) any spell that would restore the construct's Hit Points. On a critical failure, these effects have an unlimited duration.
- **Living Creature** The living creature must attempt a Fortitude save. Ageless creatures are immune.
	- **Critical Success** The living creature is unaffected.
	- **Success** The living creature briefly ages, becoming [Clumsy](Clumsy.md) 1 and [Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md) 1 for 1 round.
	- **Failure** As success, with a duration of 1 hour.
	- **Critical Failure** As success, with an unlimited duration.
- **Object** If the object is attended, its bearer can attempt a Fortitude save. If the bearer fails or the object is unattended, the object immediately takes `dice: 4d6|avg` damage (applying Hardness normally) and the item is cursed with an unlimited duration. Until the curse ends, the item becomes shoddy and can't be [Repaired](Repair.md), and the curse attempts to [counteract](Counteracting.md) any spell that would restore the object's Hit Points. [Remove Curse](Remove%20Curse.md) can target an item affected by this spell.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
