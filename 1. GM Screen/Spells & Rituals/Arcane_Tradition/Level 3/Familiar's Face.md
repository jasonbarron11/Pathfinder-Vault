The target becomes a scrying sensor, allowing you to see through its eyes, smell what it smells, and similarly use its other senses. If you can cast a spell with the [Revelation](Revelation.md) trait that affects your senses, such as [See Invisibility](See%20Invisibility.md), while this spell is active, you gain the benefit of the spell through the target's senses instead of your own. You can also speak through the target, with a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of the target's growls or squawks. You can use [Command an Animal](Command%20an%20Animal.md) on the target as part of Sustaining this Spell. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your target when you Cast this Spell.
