You unleash a holy beam of freezing moonlight. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals `dice: 5d6|avg` cold damage; if the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra `dice: 5d6|avg` good damage. Moonlight ray's cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.

**Critical Success** The target takes double cold damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.  
**Success** The target takes full damage.

If the light passes through an area of magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) or targets a creature affected by magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness), moonlight ray attempts to [counteract](Counteracting.md) the [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness). If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness), draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`.
