You evoke life essence into the form of water and freeze it, then launch the icicle at a foe. Make a spell attack roll. On a success, the icicle deals `dice: 2d6|avg` piercing damage and `dice: 1d6|avg` cold damage, and if the target is undead, the icicle deals an additional `dice: 1d4|avg` positive damage. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round as the icicle lodges inside them before melting away.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The piercing damage and cold damage each increase by `dice: 1d6|avg`. The positive damage increases by `dice: 1d4|avg`.
