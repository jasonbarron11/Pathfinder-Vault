You fill the minds of your enemies with doubt. Enemies in the area must succeed at a Will save or take a â€“1 status penalty to attack rolls as long as they are in the area. Once per turn, starting the turn after you cast bane, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet and force enemies in the area that weren't yet affected to attempt another saving throw. Bane can [counteract](Counteracting.md) [Bless](Bless.md).
