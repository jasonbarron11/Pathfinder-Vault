You conjure a 5-foot-wide rain cloud that follows the target wherever it goes. It stays roughly an arm’s length overhead, unless it must drift lower to fit under a ceiling. The cloud rains constantly on the target, keeping it wet and dampening the ground in the wake of any movement. The rain extinguishes non-magical flames. The target gains fire resistance 2. Creatures with weakness to water take damage equal to their weakness at the end of each of their turns. Creatures can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the cloud.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of fire resistance increases by 2.
