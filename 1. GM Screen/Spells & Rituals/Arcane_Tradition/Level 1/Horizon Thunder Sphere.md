You gather magical energy into your palm, forming a concentrated ball of electricity that crackles and rumbles like impossibly distant thunder. Make a ranged spell attack roll against your target's AC. On a success, you deal `dice: 3d6|avg` electricity damage. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and is [Dazzled](Dazzled.md) for 1 round. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the range and other parameters.

►► (somatic, verbal) This spell has a range of 30 feet.  
►►► (material, somatic, verbal) This spell has a range of 60 feet and deals half damage on a failure (but not a critical failure) as the electricity lashes out and jolts the target.

**Two Rounds** If you spend 3 actions Casting the Spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you do, after attacking the target, whether you hit or miss, the ball of lightning explodes, dealing `dice: 2d6|avg` electricity damage to all other creatures in a 10-foot emanation around the target (basic Reflex save). Additionally, you spark with electricity for 1 minute, dealing 1 electricity damage to creatures that Grab you or that hit you with an unarmed Strike or a non-reach melee weapon.

**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage on a hit, as well as the burst damage for two-round casting time, each increase by 2d6, and the damage creatures take if they Grapple or hit you while you're in your sparking state increases by 1.
