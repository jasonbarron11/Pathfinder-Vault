You emit a cloud of toxic smoke that temporarily obscures you from sight. Each creature except you in the area when you Cast the Spell takes `dice: 1d6|avg` poison damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature that critically fails the saving throw also becomes [Sickened](Sickened.md) 1. All creatures in the area become [Concealed](Concealed.md), and all creatures outside the smoke become [Concealed](Concealed.md) to creatures within it. This smoke can be dispersed by a strong wind.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
