You protect your target from going astray in hostile territory by tracking where it's already been, helping it deduce where it still needs to go. The target leaves a glittering trail behind it that lasts for the spell's duration. This trail doesn't denote the direction or the order of its pathâ€”it merely indicates where the target has moved during the spell's duration.
