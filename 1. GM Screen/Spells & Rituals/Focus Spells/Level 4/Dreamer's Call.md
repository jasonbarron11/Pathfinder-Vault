**Domain** dreams
**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** until the end of the target's next turn

---
The target becomes distracted and suggestible, inundated by vivid daydreams.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target's attention wavers. It becomes [Flat-footed](Flat-footed.md) and [Fascinated](Fascinated.md) by its daydreams.

**Failure** As success, except that you appear in the dream and give a suggestion. This can be to approach you, run away (as if it had the [Fleeing](Fleeing.md) condition), [Release](Release.md) what it's holding, [Drop Prone](Drop%20Prone.md), or stand in place. The creature follows this course of action as its first action after you Cast the Spell.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target follows the course of action for as many actions as possible for the spell's duration, and it does nothing else.
