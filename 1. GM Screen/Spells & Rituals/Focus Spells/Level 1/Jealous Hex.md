**Bloodline** hag
**Cast** â–º verbal

**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** up to 1 minute

---
You draw forth a hag's innate jealousy to deny a target its greatest attribute. The target is cursed with an adverse condition depending on its highest ability modifier: Strength ([Enfeebled](Enfeebled.md)); Dexterity ([Clumsy](Clumsy.md)); Constitution ([Drained](Drained.md)); or Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ([Stupefied](Stupefied.md)).

On a tie, the creature decides which of the conditions associated with the tied ability modifiers to take. The target must attempt a Will save.

**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The condition's value is 1.
**Critical Failure** The condition's value is 2.

At the start of each of your turns, the target can attempt another Will save, ending the effect on a success.
