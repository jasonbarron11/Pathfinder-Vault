Link to a heading or subheading in separate folder using this command:
[[[note#heading|Some custom text you actually want to show]]

You can also include a link that has a preview to what you are linking. It works the same as a picture. 

[[pagename]]
[[pagename|renamed link]]
[[pagename#subheadingwithinpage]]
![[pagename]] - The ! tells it to include a preview of the linked thing in the current note
