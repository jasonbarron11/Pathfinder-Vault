  - name: "Arcane Bond"
    desc: "You place some of your magical power in a special item, usually an item associated with spellcasting, like a wand, ring, or staff. Each morning when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. Once per day, you can drain your bonded item’s power to choose a spell that you already cast today and cast it again. Recalling this spell is instant, but you still have to spend the actions to cast the spell."
