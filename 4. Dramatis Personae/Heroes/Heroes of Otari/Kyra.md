abilities_mid:
  - name: "Sneak Attack"
    desc: "When your enemy can’t properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. To use sneak attack, you must use your fist, a melee weapon with the agile or finesse trait, a thrown dagger, or a ranged weapon. When you use one of these attacks to Strike a creature that has the [[Flat-footed|flat footed]] condition, you deal an extra 1d6 damage. A creature can become [[Flat-footed|flat footed]] if you surprise them with your surprise attack ability (see below), if they can’t see you because it’s dark or you’re using the Stealth skill, or if they’re directly between you and an ally. A [[Flat-footed|flat footed]] creature is easier to hit."
  - name: "Surprise Attack"
    desc: "You spring into combat faster than foes can react. On the first round of an encounter where you rolled Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven’t acted have the flat-footed condition, but only against you."
  - name: "Twin Feint"
    desc: "⬺ As a twin trickster, you fight with two weapons, using your first attack to make your foe vulnerable to your second attack. You learn the Twin Feint ability. If you’re holding a melee weapon in each of your hands, you can make a dazzling series of attacks with both weapons, using the first attack to throw your foe off guard. Make one Strike with each of your two melee weapons, both against the same target. The target is automatically flat‑footed against the second attack. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally."
